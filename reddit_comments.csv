I am a 24M who graduated university 1.5 years ago with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. Currently, I work as a quality engineer for a large aerospace company.

In my role, I use SQL almost daily and have found that I enjoy working with data in my role. I was always extremely comfortable in my mathematics courses as well. I am considering pursuing a career switch to data science and need advice (any is welcome).

I have been in my quality engineer role for about a year and a half, and I am looking to switch jobs in about 7-8 months so that is can correspond with my lease ending where I currently live:

Advice needed:
- Are data science certificates worth it? If so, any recommendations of specific programs or things to look for in a program? I would likely be able to get my employer to pay for it, but want to ensure the program is good because I will then likely not be able to drop it or I would need to pay myself.
- What sorts of specific actions should I be taking to make myself a more marketable candidate? Dive deeper into SQL, refresh myself on Python, etc? Like I said, I am early career so figured a switch is doable, and I could take the next 6 months to really build up my skills. 
- Is 6 or 7 months enough time to make myself marketable for data scientist roles?",3,1736745796.0

Little bit of background, I'm a 24 year old Bio-analytical Graduate living in Ireland. I was registered to start a Bioinformatics Masters last September which fell through last minute. I ended up enrolling in a Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science with The Data Science Institute which operates through Woolf University.

I have the option to continue my studies into a full Masters but I'm unsure as I'm weary on the status of the University (Rankings, Employer recognition, Etc.). Ideally I'm looking for an online masters as I'm working from home as a caregiver for a family member during the day.

I'm considering taking my PDip. and applying for a different full masters such as the Online Msc. Statistics and Data Science from KU Leuvan. Honestly I'm abit lost at the moment as I've had alot of opportunities fall through in the last year. I suppose I'm asking 2 main questions.

**1.** Is a Data Science masters worth it? What's the Job market like, I'm open to moving anywhere in the world.

**2.** Does the University status matter, my course is accredited in Europe and all credits are ETCS, will employers be looking into that much or are they more likely to be looking at my portfolio of past projects?

A little extra information:  
\- Use cases would be a myriad of DS/ML tasks, including shallow- and deep-learning model training on large datasets and database/API development (trivial)  
\- The ""No GPU"" option is currently selected with the knowledge that we have a 4090 lying around from a separate purchase  
\- Ideally the total price stays below $12k (slightly over would be negotiable)  
\- I don't need significant local storage, hence only the 256GB boot drive

My current thoughts are that I can either (a) decrease the RAM from 4x32GB to 2x32GB and upgrade the CPU from 7975WX to 7985WX, (b) select a GPU - 4500 Ada **or** 5000 Ada with the previously mentioned RAM decrease, or (c) upgrade the RAM from 4x32GB to 4x64GB (comes with required upgrade to a 512GB boot drive).",2,1736880028.0

[https://imgur.com/a/ds-resume-9dXon68](https://imgur.com/a/ds-resume-9dXon68)

I hold a Math degree and an MBA and after leaving a FAANG senior program manager job I didn't like 2 years ago I jumped into a DS bootcamp at exactly the right time for the tech layoffs to get started.

After 6 months of searching for a DS job I decided to take matters into my own hands and leverage my experience as a consultant and MBA to just start getting projects done independently. That was a little over a year ago. After getting a few projects & references under my belt this year (the idea was to do something impactful and analytical so my resume wasn't empty) I'm set to start searching again so I can stop selling new projects or just land a FT job that fits me, even if it's not in DS, but naturally keeping my fingers crossed.

Challenge for me is that while I've worked with Python, R, SQL, have a quantitative background, etc, most of my experience has been in strategy, analytics, and general management. I've never been a Data Scientist qua Data Scientist and I wonder if that hurts me at this stage of my career given I am pivoting (just over 30, business school in the rearview mirror).",2,1737176930.0

I want to start my own access database to track all of the bids we conduct, which bids are awarded to us, track clients, market segments, etc. We have a wealth of information that is somewhat scattered, mostly stored in excel spreadsheets.

Just to try and give an example of what I'm trying to accomplish, here is an example below:

|| || |Estimate #|2025-01-13-001| |Project Name|example project| |Bid Type|Hard Bid | |Bid Date|01/13/2025| |Anticipated Start Date|04/01/2025| |Anticipated Duration|20 weeks| |Estimator|ZEZ| |Value|1,800,000| |Client|ACME Inc.| |Architect|Generic Architect Name Inc.| |Market Segment|Retail| |Project Address|123 Address Lane, City, State, 55555, USA| |Project Square Footage|12,000 SQFT|

All of the above data is common to the whole bid/project, however, this project has more detailed cost and scope information that I want track as well. Construction specifications already have a decent organizational structure to them:

|| || |Div 01 - General conditions|$100,000| |Div 02 - Demo |$50,000| |Div 03 - Concrete|$125,000| |032000 - rebar|$15,000| |033100 - concrete foundations|$65,000| |033200 - concrete slabs|$20,000| |033900 - concrete sidewalks & paving|$25,000| |etc. etc. etc.|$$$$|

I'm pretty sure I need some sort of hierarchical data structure, because all of those sub categories of concrete roll up into the division 3 total cost for concrete. There is also other data, such as the quantity of foundations and the square footage of slabs and sidewalks that I would like to include. Also, multiple subcontractor bids that apply to this scope of work could be another related table.

Some things are easy, like regression models or arima, where you can insert the data into different models. But when it comes simulations or machine learning, I struggle to figure out both the tutorials and applications.

Maybe I can try making models from scratch to deepen my understanding? But thats sort of like an infinite learning loop. I'm not very strong in mathematics.

1i06k3y,m7iw5fj,"Hi, I know this is probably the 76000th similar post but I’m really just at a crossroads and defeated by what to do with my career.  For some context I’ve always loved applied mathematics and for as long as I can remember I wanted to be an actuary.  So I started my undergraduate academic career as a math major but at some point my naive 20 year old self thought I could make more money going the engineering route (and I was highly fond of physics).  That’s when I decided to transition into electrical engineering and added a CS minor for further marketability.  After graduating with my EE degree I got a job in the aerospace industry as an EE, but the job had zero quantitative elements to it so I switched over to software engineering after about a year for the higher pay and to actually have some problem solving  tasks rather than being a Microsoft word engineer as with the EE role.  Simultaneously about a year into my career I pursued a Master’s in Engineering Mathematics which is part of the Electrical Engineering  department at the Tier 2 university I enrolled at.  Long story short I got my Masters over a year ago and have been a software engineer for 5 years now but the whole time I’ve been looking for a more mathematically oriented job, particularly Data Science as I have done multiple projects and it’s been the only time when I’ve felt connected to my work and in the flow state other than when I was in school. 

The problem is even with an applicable background it seems like if you’re title wasn’t specifically data scientist no matter how trivial your responsibilities are it trumps my masters and even my software engineering experience.  I’m at the point where it’s inevitable that I’m going to pursue further education but I don’t know how to minimize the opportunity cost.  I’ve always been very risk adverse hence me switching to electrical engineering thinking it was broader and offered way more perspectives and then switching to software engineering thinking it was the most marketable and future proof skill set even though I’ve never loved software, I just see it as a means to an end to implement mathematical models and algorithms.  My risk adverse nature now is telling me that a literal Masters in Data Science (or something like Georgia techs MS Analytics) is too niche and I’d rather have deeper knowledge in something like a ML CS masters or even a MS Stats degree. Even then it seems like people with those degrees can’t find jobs so I don’t want to waste 3 more years of my life while working pursuing an expensive program especially with a child on the way.  I’ve also contemplated just grinding out the actuary exams with the knowledge that I’ve already encountered most of the math covered on the exams but I would only be doing that to get into Data Science since it seems like actuaries have a relatively easier time transitioning. Once again that’s a lot of unnecessary work and a massive opportunity cost of time just to get into DS. Some might wonder why not just do actuarial science then? My hesitance there is I would be starting at square one as if I just graduated from undergraduate and it would be a 40k decrease in salary and would totally nullify the masters I already obtained.  Additionally, the common consensus seems to be roles within the industry vary drastically, some are Microsoft office monkeys while others actually use the mathematics from the exams and build/analyze statistical models (ideal) but I don’t want to bank on finding myself in one of these roles since I’m learning there’s no guarantees in life.  I even contemplated maybe gaining lots of domain knowledge in something specific like finance / Econ by getting some sort of quant finance or econometrics masters degree and even taking the CFA and FRM to position myself for DS roles within the industry or even a quant analyst role.  

All that is to say is has anyone else had this rut where they’re worried they’re too far along and that they’re going to be stuck doing something they never thought they would be doing or isn’t even aligned with their best skills because the sacrifice of switching and starting over just isn’t realistic? Or am I being melodramatic and I just need to keep pursuing this and if so what even is the optimal route ? I’m willing to work hard I just don’t necessarily have the ability to quit my job and do a full time degree program or take entry level pay since once again I’ll be supporting someone other than myself here soon.  Online masters degrees, certifications, etc. I’m more than open to I just was hoping for literally any anecdotal advice other than “Boost your GitHub” because people don’t give two craps about that frankly.  It’s all about what you can shove onto the one page resume with degrees, previous work titles, etc.

These could be long-term research projects (months to years even) for which I collaborate across a team of fellow Data Science professionals (Scientists, Analysts, and Engineers on both the Applied and Pure Research side). I do, of course, also receive simpler ad-hoc requests. These requests can be as simple as digging around our many SQL databases to look for an answer, speaking with someone with domain expertise to solve a problem, or even updating an old visualization we have. The two most common problems I have encountered in my career so far are Regression and Classification problems (both Classical Statistics and Machine Learning are used on my team).

For the Git repo, at which stage does that make the most difference? Deciding whether to interview or getting past interviews?

Unfortunately my DS/software work is locked up in company repos, so all I have is academic econ stuff from before I acquired more coding skill. There are some cute Jupyter Notebooks with visualizations and preliminary analysis, but the code/commenting is pretty messy and the statistically interesting part of the analysis was done in Stata. Would you recommend investing  some time into cleaning those notebooks up, or could it have a negative effect since it might look like I'm representing that as my current ability?

I suppose ideally I would invest a lot of time into doing a personal project from scratch where I can organize the folder structure properly. What are the main attributes of a good repo or project to you? For example:

\- Does it make a difference whether it's a self-defined question with datasets cobbled together VS. something predefined like from DrivenData/Kaggle?

\- If it's from somewhere like DrivenData/Kaggle, does it have to get a really good score?

\- What level of model sophistication are you looking for?",1,1737082859.0

Samsung gestures were really gimmicky, as you could achieve the same results by (shockingly) actually touching the phone, which come with “amazing tactile feedback”.

I was granted autonomy, allowed to be creative, and was doing more actual statistics than any entry level data science role I'd ever heard of before. I was building models and leading presentation of those models to clients, two months in.

At my current role, later this year, we're going to be hiring entry level for the first time, probably at 60-70k. However, they will be granted trust, autonomy, and creative flex. Why? Because I know how valuable that was for me, and I want others to have the same opportunity.

1i3y1qs,m7y1htj,"Sure. Two years ago the Stats department renamed themselves to the Department of Statistics *and Data Science* and changed the name of the major respectively. When I entered the major, it was a Statistics major. No data science. 

I think appending DS to the department and major names was purely to match what the other UCs are doing, and because data science is a sexy buzzword. 

What I’m getting to is, the stats major curriculum is severely lacking in data science knowledge. I understand it’s hard for a school as big as ucla to quickly update their curriculum, but pretty much every other UC has rolled out their own data science curriculum or requires data science majors to take courses from relevant departments (ie computer science classes). 

I’ve talked to some ucla professors about this issue, and they say it’s hard to find professors to teach things like python and cloud computing and such because academia can’t keep up with industry salaries. I don’t personally agree with that, but that’s what I’ve been told. The department offers some useful courses as electives, but they are offered once every 1-2 years. 

Because the name change is so recent, I hope the department is working on a curriculum update. Similar to the data theory major, I think the stats department should have a joint program with the computer science department. They have the classes we need, essentially. 

If you aren’t sure what to minor in (stats major is pretty short so you should probably minor) I would look at data science engineering through the computer science department. It’s too late for me to do that minor, but I would likely be in a better position than I am now due to the classes you can take in the CS dept. 

That was my little rant, but I will tell you positives too. Overall, the professors in the department are pretty good. They can be really tough, but they grade fair and often generous. I’ve had multiple classes where the professor warns us he will teach us at a graduate level, but will consider that in our final grade (i.e he said don’t worry about your grades). 

I think as it stands, the major is in a weird spot where it doesn’t prepare you for industry and it doesn’t prepare you for academia. I think I would probably major in math of computation if I could do it again, with a minor in statistics. That gets you the CS and stats classes you want for industry, and math (linear algebra, real analysis) should you want to go into grad school. But the grass is always greener I guess. 

I didn’t really find the major excruciatingly difficult, and I don’t consider myself great at math. Keep in mind, I think I tend to underestimate myself and overestimate others. Dunning Kruger effect and all that.

All you need is a rare edge. It can happen once every handful of years and only make you ~10%. That’s enough to beat the market in the long run for very little work. It’s important to be hands off with it, so it truly is a side project that does not distract from your 9 to 5. A similar alternative is any sort of international trade. Buy something for cheap in one country and sell it for a markup in another country. This is trading but with physical items instead of stock. It takes the same kind of analysis.

I’ll give an example. Banks hedge with overnight swaps if they see risk in the market. They’re required by law to do this, so even if the bank thinks it’s not optimal they still do it. Do some economic risk analysis and see what the real risk is then sell them shares to hedge against when it’s safe to do so. Gain the difference. 

Another example is power companies take a while to ramp power generation up and down. To smooth this out they sell power in advance. Figure out how much power is actually needed in an area from analyzing the weather then buy power early then sell it for a mark up when it’s in demand. You can do this with oil too.",2,1737273457.0

I see there's an upvoted comment saying that they're a thing but because they're asking for LinkedIn/email, they're fake - but, get ready - they're still legit. I've done this thing myself with them. What they want to do is create a fake resume for you essentially, to bump up your years of experience so that you match the number of years of experience for the clients who are working with their recruiting agency. They typically demand 10+ years of experience, which most of us seeking jobs don't have. So, in order to make it look legit, they ask you to suspend your LinkedIn and create a new one, and add legitimate connections from your field (Data Science, SDEs) so that it comes across as organic, in case the client company checks your LinkedIn once your resume is out he's to them by the recruiting agency. 

It's shady and unethical, but not a scam. I know many Indians who have gotten jobs through this and have to pay 20% of their salary to the client since they did get recruited. Typically, the way to tell a scam is if their business model is not transparent and looks too good to be true, which is not the case here.

I had done this thing with them only momentarily only so that I can show myself as employed - and I was forced to comply with their demands since I signed up with them. While they did their thing and marketed my fake profile and got me time, I applied sneakily on my own as well and eventually got a job on my own and simply ended the agreement with them once I did. The only risk here was that I had to maintain my original LinkedIn along with their fake one, but I decided that if a hiring manager who I personally applied to were to question the dual profiles (nobody did), I'd just play dumb and pretend the other profile is another person with the same name. The fake profile also has fake education and work experience and also didn't have my profile picture, so it would be easy to do so. 

It kinda sucks and I don't enjoy that I had to do it - this kind of stuff is not to my taste personally. But there are people who go through the process without applying separately on their own like I did and still do well. They take the 20% cut for one year only, beyond that it's a normal job with 100% of the salary going to you. Many students see that as fair game since they were not getting jobs to begin with. You may argue that it's unfair to other students, and you'd be right, but at the end of the day the only thing being faked is your years of experience, not the interview rounds.

That was me and my specific situation, anyhow. My point here, I tried to project myself and my carer into the future to formulate a vision for myself.

1i3a45a,m7so78m,"Instead of asking how many applications you should be sending per day, focus on the steps you should be taking. I get it, job seekers often prefer quantity over quality. But in my experience, what really helps land a job is sending quality applications. That said, it's essential to tailor your resume for each specific role. Recruiters use ATS to filter applications, so incorporating the right keywords into your CV is crucial. If you're looking for ways to streamline this process, tools like ChatGPT can help, and you can find helpful prompts on r/resumes. You might also consider using a resume builder like Jobsolv to help you craft tailored resumes. I also recommend applying directly on company websites, as job boards are often flooded with fake postings.

Additionally, I suggest not quitting your current job unless you have something lined up. It's much less stressful to job search while you're still employed. Beyond your resume, networking is key. Optimize your LinkedIn profile, and don't hesitate to reach out to recruiters. Data science is a competitive field, so expect some rejection and ghosting.

I don't know about in Italy, but in the UK the DS market is completely different now compared to 2017. There are just so many recent grads with masters degrees, personal projects etc that if a client was willing to hire someone without much experience you'd be competing against a huge pool of other people for the job.

To be blunt, unless you've got a PhD if you have no previous work experience then you're just not going to be very credible to a potential employer. You're the subject matter expert and they're paying you to come in and deliver a project (usually) because they don't have the skills to deliver it internally. You have to be credible enough that they trust you to go away and do that with minimal guidance, because there's often no one in the business with the expertise required to guide you or to notice if what you're doing is wrong/poor.",50,1737023242.0

I don't mean to denigrate anyone's lack of experience. But my experience has been... there's no substitute for experience BUT experience.


I was in a Data Science Masters program, with about 50% of the candidates having less than two years of work experience, a handful with 2-5 years experience, and the rest with five or more years of experience. I worked on class projects with students from all three groups.


Out of the first group, there wasn't a single one that I would trust to be a freelance data scientist without first working under the supervision of a experienced D.S. Not one.


Some of them had potential, I'm not saying they didn't. It's just that too many of them were all too happy to throw numbers into a computer and trust the result, even when the result didn't pass the simplest common sense tests.


In a field where data quality (and validation) are so important for getting good results, I felt that too many of the students with minimal experience were cavalier about getting things right from the start.

Sure, I know that. Maybe calling it a ""cheat code"" is a little overblown. But I think people tend to forget that this is an option in a world with Fiverr, Upwork, and other websites. 

I would like to add to what I previously said (not for you, but for anyone else who drops by into the sub): where it becomes more powerful as an option comes from highlighting of demonstrable skillsets.

When people are looking for temp/freelance workers in the market, they usually require a strong evidence of doing a specific thing or things (usually through very specific work experience of insert X years on a resume). If I know Johnny-o-Bonney was good at working with some esoteric models with specific tooling from a previous project that he did for me, I currently have no one on the team that can work with the models, and now Johnny-o-Bonney is a freelancer....well Johnny-o-Bonney can get a project. This is as opposed to someone I do not know who sent me a message online or who's profile I saw on a freelance website.

I'm going to post one more exaggeration: If I have 5 years of Data Science experience and I have 30 people that I have consistently networked with and demonstrated my skills to in projects, then I have the potential to be better off than someone with the same years of experience who hasn't done that networking effort.",1,1737053852.0

As for the cheating what would indicate cheating as I do personally find AI to be very helpful to speed up the work and the grunt work. Especially when I am reusing old code and trying to make my code more modular.

Like i do get ur point but if someone gonna cheat they gonna cheat. When my team was hiring we had a person use an “ai” assistant and it was obvious when we did in person interviews that he memorized the questions as AI gives surface level answers.

Like my solution isnt something that you can get out of an AI as there is a lot of depth in it and infact took me a long time to learn on my own to implement prior to even getting the interview. Even then a lot of people do use AI on the job because it genuinely helps speed up grunt work like going over packages and even remembering code that i dont have with me anymore.

In short, if building the pipeline is a significant investment of resource, and your people could be doing something else that creates value, then you might want to wait until you're sure you've got something when it comes to the model.

Otherwise, if the pipeline is a simple piece of work that can be built in parallel using dummy (nonviable) models, I say do that! No fancy bells and whistles though—just the minimum needed to make it work.

Eventually a step gets missed, or the creative individual finds themselves managing ""copying a file"".

Time/Money is always a problem to balance, but not having appropriate infrastructure in place reduces future productivity... to the point it may become negative.

1i28x7i,m7ex7f3,"A little preface: I’ve built these systems in different stages of startups. Some from the ground up with a skeleton crew of only a couple engineers including me, some for MVPs, and some for established products that need enhancements.

This really depends on the stage of your startup. If you’re in the “get something out the door now” crunch then you might be taking up too much time with a fully blown pipeline (if you’re talking end to end model lifecycle). Speeding through stuff will incur tech debt, but sometimes you need to in this world. It sounds like this is your first product, so this will set the platform for future development. Tech debt now will be painful down the road. Make sure your stakeholders are aware of this so you can take the appropriate amount of time you need.

If you’re just stringing together models for deployment and don’t have a huge time crunch, I would say you might want to take a step back and draw out the design first and understand everyone’s requirements, unit/integration tests now will save you time and from headaches in the long run. As well as making sure everyone is as independent as can be.


Here’s the most important bit: 

If others need your outputs for their development, let them know what the output structure and types are. They should be able to write unit/integration tests for those and be independent of you. This also goes for web dev teams. This will allow you to run your test suite for your changes without having a model actually in it. It will also save time because you don’t need to run data processing and inference, which can take a lot of time cumulatively.

After your models are in, the tests should have covered what you needed from others. And things should flow smoothly.",2,1737010890.0
1i28x7i,m7ejjjq,"In my own experience it's very worthwhile to get a pipeline up & running as soon as possible. I've taken 4 substantial projects from ideation to full deployment in the past 2 years.

Having said that, some conditions should align first, imho.

Getting a pipeline ready in time for PoC full runs, just to have an inferior product doing a poor job, can be devastated for a start up company in the trenches. Bad visuals can kill a company at any stage, let alone when breaking out. 

Product shifts are very, very common at this stage. You work +1 year on some image processing tool for security cams, only to find a solid market in Maritime surveillance sensors... Or you imagine an end-user app to solve your user facing UI, but eventually find a market in a traditional industry that wants your product inserted into their own SaaS suite, nullifying the app and setting you to start coding SDK libs and wrappers till death do you apart. You know the drill. Happens all the time. Committing to a tech stack for a full pipeline can tie you up with heavy sunk costs. 

No BI or analytics people on board when the company's young is the most crucial hit mark imo. Pipelines are easy at first. Falling through long-term pits is also quite easy.

Similar for other offerings you'd try to go to market with.

Also what expenses at a local shop are you going to track that they don't already have visibility into? For instance, most likely their top expenses are labor and rent. How much do you expect to charge say a $1-2M business (revenues) that makes say $250k in profit before tax, and what's the value you're adding? E.g. how will a $20k per year investment in your service save $25k more?

 Point is before embarking on any of this, you need to envision the ideal end state of your offering (the capability your service offering will unlock and the value it will add to a business) and then work your way backwards towards the cost of you to produce it, fair market value you could offer it, then actual value add to the buyer where there's a clear ROI to the buyer.

To get yourself off the ground, go around to these places and talk to their owners and managers to understand their current state, challenges, and top priorities. I'd start there.

If you haven't got 3 years of experience yet and you're already finding the work soul destroying then that's pretty concerning.

> after 3-4 years of experience where I’ve built some niche industry experience

3-4 YOE is roughly when I'd expect someone to be a normal, well rounded DS. Unless you're spending that whole period working on one specific area (e.g 3 years of building a deploying different recommendation systems or time series models) then you're not really going to be brining much specialist knowledge to the table. And to be honest, the examples you've given *aren't* niche - they're pretty much as generic DS work as you can get. Most of the smaller DS consultancy companies I've seen aim to be very specialised, industry leaders in 1 or 2 specific areas. A big company like Deloitte might do more standard DS work (because they got their foot in the door through some other consulting work they're doing for the company), but smaller companies seem to get by by being highly specialised SMEs.",1,1737033533.0

1i20otn,m7huf3z,"Sure.

Experience... I don't have a lot to compare it to.  I worked as an employed consultant when I left uni, and bounced between consulting firms over my career.

I've had two jobs where I wasn't a consultant.  One was in IT and I hated it. I do not belong in IT, I go to work to make things better for customers and the fact I use programming and stuff to do it is incidental.  The other job is running data science for a company, which has pros and cons compared to being a consultant.

As your own consultancy you are tiny.  I really missed getting to lead big important projects, but senior executives just aren't willing to give those projects to a tiny boutique consultancy.  

Mostly the work is fun.  I love being able to say ""y'know, I bet DS would be awesome in HR and just go out, win a tender and start working on that"". I also love being able to realize I just don't like working with someone and... Just not work with that company. For example I find insurance boring.

Day to day.  It's different; I dislike all the sales, having to stay super organized and follow up with people every month.  Having to push people to sign contracts.  Writing quotes, invoices, chasing purchase orders and payments.  I got into this because I love DS, not admin!  

But equally I love that as a consultant you are respected as an expert, and can drive all sorts of improvements.  I enjoy presenting to the executive leadership team or the board and getting them to pay a bit more attention to data than anecdotes.  

On a daily basis I do more data engineering or PowerPoint than data science.  It's just not time efficient to hand over a task that's less than about a week.  

Financially I like that how good I am at my job is my income.  I wish it was how good I was at data science instead, because sales and admin are a large part of my job and I suck at them.  I dislike just how variable it is - I'm writing fixed price quotes and hiring staff, so if I underestimate the work then I will lose a lot of money.  It makes personal budgeting a mission.

In the context of hypothesis testing, this means presenting the evidence against the hypothesis in such a manner that anyone can apply their personal prior to come to beliefs about whether the hypothesis is true or not.

This is also happening exactly with the e-value. A likelihood ratio is an e-value; e-values are a generalization of likelihood ratios. So you can simply multiply your prior odds with an e-value to end up with your posterior beliefs about the hypothesis.

This is much harder if someone has already imposed some prior for you: you need to first “strip away” their prior and then apply your own to come to your posterior beliefs.

1i0x2pm,m74rpnr,"There is a lot of bad Pandas code out there because of how many alternatives Pandas provide. I think accessing columns with a period is an abomination (`df.col`), but I know that users like it. I prefer (`df['col']`) as it is more ergonomic to create functions.

As for `df.loc`, this is challenging to understand initially, but once you do, it becomes incredibly powerful.


The following expression returns the column name on the rows in which the column categories contains the word ""pizza"" (case-insensitive).

```python
df.loc[df['categories'].str.contains(""pizza"", case=False), ['name']]
```

If this is something you would do on an ongoing basis, you can write as a function and then pass it to any DataFrame that has the same characteristics.

```python
def contains_substring(any_df: pd.DataFrame, substring: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return any_df.loc[df[""categories""].str.contains(""substring"", case=False), [""name""]]
```

Then you could use your function by using the pipe method, `df.pipe(contains_substring)`.

It works in the following fashion `df.loc[condition for rows (required), columns selected]`

As for if else pattern matching, I do believe Polars does it better with their `pl.when().otherwise`, but you can obtain similar results with either Numpy `np.select` or even simpler using base Python, e.g., You want to create a column given an if-else, you could write.

```python
(
    df.assign(
        new_col=(df[col] > 5).map(
            {True: ""Larger than five"", False: ""Not larger than five""}
        )
    )

I would throw out fastapi, any neural network/ llm packages, and even Polaris or pandas using the arrow backend.  Even RStudio is ready to shift more towards Python changing to POSIT and porting Shiny to python

I'll give R some credit for being well liked for ad-hoc analytics. I think that is the sweet spot. My negative is that every R programmer installs half the world with tidyverse and wants to deploy their code with tidyverse installed. I also find R hard to work with because every R programmer uses a different package / function to do the same thing. For instance, I remember there being multiple join functions for dataframes at one point between base r, dplyr, tidyverse and half of them didn't work.

That being said, I've worked to deploy both languages in containers, but would recommend Python to anyone trying to choose between the two.

Both languages have strengths and flaws, and if we can’t discuss and critique them reasonably, then how do we expect the languages and the ecosystem to improve?

Pandas was great and necessary a decade ago when Python didn’t have any alternatives. But even its creator recognizes its limitations and has moved on to projects that try to do things better.

Python comes with a great standard library for general purpose programming, which is why software people love it, but it wasn’t designed for data analysis. The real comparison isn’t R vs Python but R vs Numpy/SciPy/pandas. Python doesn’t come with BLAS and LAPACK out of the box. Python doesn’t come with any form of array computing or linear algebra out of the box.

And shipping the PyData stack is an enormously difficult undertaking that requires fighting Python’s lack of packaging standards and ultimately led to developing completely custom packaging toolchains by the scientific Python community. End users don’t see that struggle (but sometimes experiences its effects whenever pip fails because it can’t resolve the dependency hell). Working in Python often means ending up with dozens of copies of scientific C/Fortran libraries scattered around your system, because so many packages have to vendor their own versions.

Out of this, Python now has a substantially better and more diverse ecosystem of packaging and developer tools than R does, but this was out of necessity because of how bad Python is at packaging in the first place.

You merge on the time columns. Then both series will have NaN in some rows, each respectively on the rows where it was the other serie that had a sample.


You use the interpolate or fill (not sure what's the right name anymore) method to populate these nans. Naturally, you might want to do a linear interpolation to bridge the gap between the known values of a single series.


You select the interpolation method called ""linear"".


Well, it's not actually doing a linear interpolation based on your time index. What it'll do if I remember correctly, is it will do a linear interpolation between the nearest previous and next available measurement and assume constant (as in, on a per-row basis) variation.


I.e. the value calculated there will have nothing to do with the time index value in your dataframe. If you had
1 , NaN , Nan, Nan, 13


you will get
1, 4, 7, 10, 13.


Regardless of whether your time steps are constant or varying.


To get the linear interpolation based on the index you'll need to select, I think, ""index"" for the interpolation mode. Which is extremely easy to overlook.

I focus on machine learning and quasi-causal analyses that relate to the machine learning models we produce. There is a pretty cool resurgence of quasi-causal statistical analysis because we have so much methodological development around observational data as opposed to clinical data. 

In other words, there are ways to approximate randomization, and machine learning models sometimes provide really good opportunities to use those approaches effectively. 

One simple example would be a predicted index generated by an ml model that had a customer treatment at a cut point along that index.

But then I was forced to abandon the idea when I realised that the practical treatment dosage is close 0, when C is close to F - the area where RDD specially relies on.

Mine did work in a couple cases where sample size was sufficient.

I ended up writing a pretty substantial review of the rdrobust:: library in R for my colleagues as well. It was fun because it encouraged me to do a lot of simulations by varying the parameters of the rdd amid some nested for loops. This gave me the opportunity to see how sensitive the rdd outputs are to a range of parameters. 

I think the kernel smoothing parameter around the cut point was one of the more influential given the data I was working with. But that's partly why I was interested; it's non-parametric, so so you can test all of these different parameters given the data and make some reasonable comparisons between your approaches.

1i0c3x8,m6yonms,"Most likely its an H1B tactic. A lot of big companies retain a continuous set of H1B slots by posting roles and never filling them, just in case they identify a candidate they want for a real role that needs H1B sponsorship. If you're approved to hire an H1B for a DS role, it doesn't have to be a specific job on a specific team. You can shift an approved H1B from your ghost role to a real role when you need it (within reason). This process also helps companies justify the H1Bs and fulfill the requirement to confirm that no citizens meet your needs (you interviewed them and didn't hire them). 

This isn't entirely abusive of the system. It is, but the abuse is required to make the system work. When you find a candidate you want (assume the process was actually fair and followed the law with respect to interviewing citizens before looking at H1Bs; this often isn't true, but that's a different problem) and discover that they need sponsorship its too late to apply for the H1B. Takes forever, and you might not get it, which screws both the candidate and the company.

1hyploh,m6jjujq,"Well, to be honest this just isn't a strong resume.  I've hired many data scientists, analysts and engineers over the years.  The first thing that stands out to me is that you don't have formal education in stats or modeling. That's not necessarily a problem, but I'm not seeing any explanation for the transition from front end to ML.  This reads as very junior to me and likely someone that is going to need guidance on things like model selection, evaluation and interpretation.  

Thats not to say any of that is true, but as a hiring manager you get 100s of these and you're really just glancing through looking for something to stand out.  

The second thing that makes the resume weak is you arent focusing enough on impact. I'd rather see you detail one super high impact project and what skills that entailed than the generic stuff about your job role.  This is especially important to me in a data science role.  I expect you to understand metrics and how to communicate results. You do a little, but nothing that made me say ""oooo"", i want to hear about this problem and how it was solved.

Edit- as an example the first bullet on developing a predictive model that improved predictions by 25%.  You have a metric but this reads like something anyone could look up.  I want to be able to ask you questions about this but it's too generic.  What type of predictive model did you develop?  25% improvement to what end?  Who needed this info and why?.   You could say something like evaluated several regression models against dataset on patient frailty.  Improved doctors ability to anticipate falls by 25% across xx patients and recieced blah blah award for the work.

1hyploh,m6jjeis,"Some nitpicks:  

When mentioning metrics, you need to put them into context (I.e. magnitude of impact) and choose the most appropriate ones. The reason being, the best people at hiding insignificant results and making them look good to non technical stakeholders by cherry picking metrics are ironically data scientists. Accuracy is not a great metric here. For example, readmission is a rare event and accuracy isn’t great for reporting performance in the setting of class imbalance. The way it’s written in your resume tells me that you still need to work on how to interpret and report your results. 

Were the 70k records pulled from a DB? Did you need to do the data engineering with the initial number of records? (usually in the 100s of thousands for a decent health system to millions in the case of EHR providers) mention this number if you have it too, along with the DEng methods. It’s important to know if you had to join all of the tables and do the queries for the medical records. Anyone who’s done this knows its a huge and tedious task.

I’m not sure what you mean by “positively impacting 95k records.” 

The improving “operational efficiency” bullet sounds like fluff unless you say what it actually impacted and how.

There are inconsistencies in your objective and what you’ve written in your bullets, that if I were reading this would give me pause.

70k medical records is not a “large scale dataset.” Its on the smaller end of medical record datasets. “Deploying advanced ML models” is not helping either. The only ML models I see explicitly mentioned are SVM and logistic regression. These are fine to use, but I would be careful when combining this bit of information with “advanced.” I don’t see what you did to deploy models. Are you using a registry? Inference server?

Basically saying you built a model isnt impressive especially with how easy it is to build a model. Whats harder is improving on a process and quantifying the lift. 

For example in my case i showcased my workflows i incorporated raised our models by 1-3% auc across the board and were more robust. Not to mention I was able to introduce more analytics work that helps with model validation beyond test train splits. I also did open source work for personal projects for a portfolio that addresses gaps in industry. 

Things like this help make you standout than the conventional ds who just spent their time without actually improving processes.

Another example is mention how you lead projects and take ownership of ideas and the quantify how this idea added to the company bottom line. Even better is if you can modernize a team by introducing cloud and simplifying workflows. For example my team rewrites code in java to productionize a model, however i think we should move to docker and go to cloud to reduce code overhead and have more robust models. Stuff like this also enable you to get exposure to the full model life cycle which is something you completely lack in the resume.  You mentioned all the skills like GCP, AWS, but no where in your actual experience did you specify what you did.

What you are trying to do is basically say, if my current employer didn’t hire me what significant difference would have been if they hired a basic data scientist and trained them instead of you. This showcases how you are more valuable than the competition and often not requires a lot of effort.

* No GitHub repo (maybe in blackout section?). I tend to look for people's GitHub repos when hiring a data scientist-like profile. It helps weed out non-contributors and fakes. It is also useful to get an idea of how much people are looking. 

* The claims that you improved accuracy of models by 25% or 40%, increased engagement by 30%, etc... will very likely be seen as bluster. Either you came into companies with extraordinarily weak teams that had never implemented a model, or your model assessment is not factoring in overfitting, or both. It is unthinkable to me to routinely improve models by double digit percentage figures in places that have expert or even semi-expert teams in place. If your companies have had teams that routinely were weak, expect your experience to count less at more sophisticated companies. 

* Lots of phrases that sound good but I am not immediately sure what they mean. ""...optimized ensemble models for feature extraction"" could mean you extracted features that led to improved ensemble model predictions, or that your ensemble models enabled you to extract important features from your data (though to what end is unclear) 

Overall, when I read your CV I don't immediately see a Sr  role in data science or ML. The numbers and the descriptions of the projects simply do not line up with what I expect from a senior role. There is a lot of effort on ensuring people know you know tools in this CV, and almost no effort in ensuring people understand the role you played in shaping these efforts. Bear in mind that deploying a random forest today is as easy as typing RandomForest.fit(X, y), so your CV should ideally reflect a deep insight you managed to generate at your positions (for a data sci role) or a significant advance that allowed you to deploy and build the correct ML pipeline (ML)

Hard disagree with this point. Resume should be in descending order of importance i.e. from most important at the top to least important at the bottom.

If you didn't mention something, does it mean you can't do that?

IMO the best order is experience -> education -> everything else incl. skills. Reverse the first two if you don't have any valuable experience (e.g. recent grad).

1hyploh,m6oy1xh,"ATS or Application Tracking System is an application used by companies to sort the most suited resumes for the job and then those resumes are forwarded onto the HR representatives.

If you have a low ATS score, your resume is at a low risk of getting shortlisted by the application. A high ATS score will most likepy lead to your resume at least pass the application. The resume still can get rejected at any further steps.

Now, why even care about ATS. So when a job opens hundreds and thousands of applicants apply for the role. In order to find the best suited candidate, it's impossible for the recruiters to have a look at the resume individually and hence ATS comes into the picture.

But now let's talk about publishes research paper in terms of ""does it show DL/ML ability"". I would say yes. I've seen people more interested in the mathematics of DL/ML rather than the implementation part. So a candidate who has let's say published a new finding on let's say Random Forest Classifier.

They were more ""how do you approach the problem"" kinda rounds. But yes I would say DSA helps a lot.

A “predictive analytics” model back in 2015 would have taken 3 months from ideation, data collection, feature selection, etc to deployment. Today it can take 3 weeks. Automation, ease of use, scale, has been the trend (I would add Responsible AI in there as well).

1hyte5x,m6p1tcp,"European here, so really not an expert on the American resumes. What I can try to talk about, though, is my understanding of the business side - and mostly it's the attempt to try and convey different viewpoints you might consider your resume from. Please note, that this is entirely subjective, so take it with a giant grain of salt.

One thing that I noted while reading your resume that - from a layman's perspective - I can't always tell at a first glance if you're:

a) a productive data scientist/engineer with in-depth skills who generates the kind of business impact that would tell me it's worth to take 300k a year and invest it into you.

b) a newby using the slang to look bigger than they are.

c) a researcher-type person who's really brilliant and capable but doesn't understand business at all and is mostly interested in the technology.


For any open position there will be hundreds or even thousands of people of category b).

When you apply for a job - and let's assume a person looks at your resume - then you have anywhere between 10 seconds to 2 minutes to grab their attention and let them know that you are indeed the person they're looking for.

-----

To pick one example that caught my eye:
""Designed and implemented the entire data analysis, modelling, visualisation process"" at a startup.

This might mean you developed a fully engineered data process with state of the art, automated backend technology that is still running  today, and the company relies heavily on it to generate a significant chunk of their money from it.

It could also be read as: I wrote three badly documented Jupyter notebooks that need to be executed manually on a CSV file that Data Scientist B curates by hand and sends by email. The notebooks need to be run in sequence but will probably break when Mars meets Saturn - and no one has figured out why. Also, it is a very nice insight but if it didn't exist, then the company wouldn't really notice.

I'm assuming you mean the first version. But do take a moment and consider that I - a business person - just read, let's say: 50 resumes from ""newbie"" Data Scientists who all promote their Coursera skills like they're some kind of Data God. I have another 100 that I need to read and I'm stressed because I have my regular work to do and timelines to meet. So, even if I know that I should read your resume in full, it's probably not going to happen.

Also, while I'm technically minded and smart - I don't really understand what half your technology is about. It's not necessarily that I don't care, but to me most of it is fluff that I need to make sense of. I'll probably ask my more technical colleagues to judge that technical part. So, I'll judge you on the part that I do understand and ignore the rest.


Once I reached the end of your resume, it's relatively clear to me that you probably are quite a smart programmer and data engineer who can probably solve math-heavy problems confidently. ""Probably"" - I'm still assuming and interpreting a lot. If I made it this far, and I'm still assuming, that is not a good sign


A quick summary here, it is not immediately clear to me what type of applicant you are - and it is your job to convince me, taking into account that less competent people might look the same to me on paper, skill-wise.

-----

A point on uncertainties: Taking your startup experience, it is preceded and followed by FAANG experiences, so _I assume_ you are probably not bad at what you do otherwise they wouldn't have (re-)hired you. But I shouldn't have to assume. Assumptions mean that there's uncertainty left - and uncertainty means that I'm not clear on what's going on. From a business perspective, I have to minimise uncertainty and - as a candidate - I need you to help me with that.

I'll probably not go to my boss and tell them that I want to spend 30 hours of company time each for 8 candidates who I _assume_ might be good. I'll probably also not confidently tell my boss, hey this is the person I consider a solid 300k a year investment for our department.

It's your job - more generally with any business partner, really - to remove as much uncertainty and complexity as you can for them. It's also - more specifically - your job as a candidate to write a clear and easy to understand text for them to be able to judge you as a candidate. Make it easy for me to advertise you to my boss. 😉

Now, the tricky part is that everyone has a different viewpoint. So, if you know your resume will be read by a senior data engineer and ""fellow geek"", then yes, highlighting the technical skills will be the focus. The technical person will be able to map your skills onto the technical processes that they have.


If your audience is a person that is less technical (business-focus) they have entirely different processes to consider. What it usually boils down to is business metrics - because everybody can understand and translate metrics (if they're clear). In every company I've been to you have a mix of people who have different experience - technical and business-focussed.

What I personally would try to figure out when reading your resume is:

- What measurable thing did you achieve (money saved, efficiency gained...)?

- How did you achieve that (technical, organisational, management/communication work, ...)?

- how did you interact with others (worked in a team and enabled them through your expertise and communication skills, or provided an insular technical solution without too much business engagement)? Both are valid but might qualify you differently in my mind.

I'd also accept ""softer"", non-quantifiable outcomes, of course, because I know that good metrics are really hard to design. But these are even more difficult to put in words. So, designing the data analytics process is something that I know is valuable even if there's no number attached to it - but I'm still missing crucial information. (I'm not saying, write so that _I_ understand. More like: consider how your resume might be read from different viewpoints).



In another comment you mentioned political grand standing making it difficult for you to judge the value of some of the work. For 300k, I'd expect you be someone who at least tries and does their best to look beyond that political stuff, and still be able to tell me what the value for the department/company was. It's easier said than done, of course. But if you're the kind of person who can do that, you're more likely to be the person who can do that kind of job.



To wrap it up, I'd need you to prove to me from a glance at your resume that you're a person who has the technical skills and can translate that into tangible value for the company. I'd also need you prove to me that this major investment of 300k means you can navigate the complex business landscape of ""my""company - a company that is complex enough to be able to afford 300k, in the first place.


And for that, you also need the right ""word salad."" 😄",4,1736655851.0

The following naive query to simply find guards who accessed an incorrect door during a game returns zero rows. And this is not even filtering based on `type = 'Squid Game'`.

If you look at the classic grocery store example, you can easily call up customer A on a date and see 2 transactions, one of which was 2 apples, a banana, and 5 oranges. Transactions like this are pretty simple. 

Now let's look at non-profits. Steve and Sandy Giverton made a decision for a gift of $500,000 to be given over the course of 5 years. 

Year 1 is a stock exchange which increases in value by the time the funds clear. 

Year 2 is a stock exchange which decreases by the time the funds clear. 

Year 3 is a donor-advised fund, which is legally a separate entity and cannot actually be applied to the original donor. 

Year 4 includes a matching gift from their employer, but no transaction number is given to show who initiated the gift. 

Year 5 is not yet due, but it's a future gift expectancy. 

Let's assume Sandy is the primary donor (hard credit) and Steve receives recognition credit (or soft credit, same thing). Here, you have to model the difference between revenue (actual dollars) and pledges (future dollars). A pledge payment is revenue, but not a pledge itself. 

The stock exchange is actually a transfer that comes from something like Schwab Charitable. The DAF may include credit to a large number of other people on the same transaction. The matching gift comes from yet another entity which does not share the same name as Sandy Giverton's employer.

With this information, the goal would be to do things like count hard credit donors, soft credit donors (while making sure not to count someone who already has hard credit), dollars (hard credit only) and future expectancies.

Here is my thinking process, and you are free to correct me. Currently, we only have tools that are great for static metrics(ie, metrics you want to consistently measure over a period of time) eg profit %, revenue etc. But what if you want to ask a once-off ad-hoc request like the one shown in the example prompts? ""Is there a relationship between recipe complexity and user satisfaction?.""  
This requires an analyst to go investigate for a couple of days(factoring in typical cooperate red tape where meets need to be setup, powerpoint presentations to present the results etc etc) and come back with a solution at the very least, but with this app you can just ask and get a reply immediately.",-5,1736610731.0

1hyxec6,m6ll1qf,"Would you want to grant the tool the ability to generate and execute arbitrary code against a company database? Many companies will have rules against this for security reasons, and there’s a high risk of invisible failures/hallucinations as things simply not working as hoped for. Meaning any business user will be contacting you every few seconds. 

So then you’re left with coding up a bunch of tools to cover expected/acceptable use cases and then use langgraph to orchestrate. If you only have ‘one’ user then this may be a feasible task, but if you serve multiple business units with varying needs and databases it might be very time consuming to produce reliable for all of them.

Note that my company has been trying things along these lines and the other problem is that business users actually didn’t necessarily want it. Of course this last point might be specific to my company, but I suspect the first two points are common issues.",2,1736614405.0

1hxalxo,m69geka,"Things a data scientist should know about job searching:

1. Hiring is cyclical. Usually headcount allocations are made once, at the beginning of the fiscal year, at which point the race is on from the hiring managers perspective to get that role filled because many work places have a “use it or lose it” approach to headcount. These cycles usually follow company fiscal years with quarterly reviews on reallocations and clawbacks. 

2. There’s a second set of cyclic behaviors which are the major holiday periods. My experience has been that i  the US this means nothing big happens from mid November thru early January. Smaller companies will typically have an easier time flexing around this than big companies. Most companies treat these kinds of hiring decisions as being important enough to defer until all the relevant stakeholders are able to meet. This gets even worse when hiring committees get involved, because there’s another layer between interviewers and the final approval that matters. 

3. Track HR and management news sources and stay informed. There are a lot of shitty behaviors that companies are currently engaged in which make any job seekers experience unnecessarily worse. Case in point: advertising openings without having a corresponding requisition — these are just fishing trips to see if by chance a “rockstar” or “10-x-er” or otherwise superhuman candidate applies. Remember: companies rarely change how they choose to treat people unless it’s to go from bad to worse, so if you’re unhappy about the recruiting experience imagine how much worse it can get when folks aren’t trying to sell you.",21,1736446135.0
1hxalxo,m67ptkj,"It felt like this week surpassed all of 2023 for me.

Prior to ""2020"" I don't recall such hiring floods in January.  Seems maybe people adjusted to a new normal? But also, hiring froze last year in March/April and then June, and the bottom fell out in August until December.  So, we'll see how this year progresses.

Companies usually hire in June so they can launch in fall, and they'll hire in March/April so they can launch in summer.  So there's another month and a half of opportunities after February until the summer lull.  But then after September, it's a downhill slip during the last quarter.  By October budgets are frozen solid for the next 6 months unless urgent.

How did people job hunt prior to July 2008?  I don't know of any January flood hiring prior to that time.  It's both a new and old hiring strategy.

What I would tell younger people is that there used to be Dec-17 to Feb-1 shut downs for wage work.  Companies usually started recruiting a month and a half ""after"" the holidays, and sometimes posting ads would pick up dramatically in March/April.  You also never knew how many people left jobs in December or got promoted in January, which opened up opportunities by March/April. But the ""official"" once a year hiring was definitely in the summer. Sometimes companies would hire in the fall for a ""holiday"" campaign for retail customers but that's not like January hiring now, which is a very recent thing.

Basically job agencies adjusted to the behavior of unemployment lines stretching around the corner in January or something, but nowhere did such a large amount of people search for jobs as in the past 6 years, or take time off to search for jobs as in the last 20 years.  So in some way things have changed profoundly. Not sure what.",31,1736425489.0

Professional maturity is something most recent grads lack plus industry domain knowledge are important for analytics.

1i4rz3r,m7yg024,"Over fitting is from either structural risk or empirical risk. Structural risk means that your classifier can't hold the right amount of information for a generalising classifier. It used to be thought that big NN's would overfit because they would memorize everything, but deep learning showed this was not true. Broad learning (2/3 layers with 100's of vertex's) should work the same way but it turns out that it's unbelievably slow, surprisingly deep learning goes fast with Hinton's tricks. 

So - try very deep networks like >50 layers? 

The other issue is MLP; the bias in MLP's is that all the data points in the input are equally related to each other. This can make it very difficult for the classifier to be learned. How about using a CNN or a Transformer - these have biases toward positional structures... I think (it's been a while since I read about it) that Transformers have a more flexible positional bias than a CNN and therefore get some advantage, but I \*guess\* that if you learn for a very long time on any of these large networks you will get an equivalent classifier. It's just that MLP's and CNN's will take much much more compute. (this is guessing).

I really recommend checking the course descriptions out, they're very new courses and have fairly detailed descriptions. 

They cover ""optimization, simulation, and implimentation"" through topics including the EM algorithm and its variants (ECM, MCEM, etc); Bayesian computation: MH & Gibbs samplers, adaptive MCMC, Hamiltonian MC, variational inference; feature selection (penalized GLMs, etc); dimension reduction (PCA, factor analysis etc), data compression (k-means, hierarchical, and spectral clustering).

The U of T courses aren't focused only on machine learning, but also on broader techniques in statistical computation, so you could swap some less ML-relevant topics for other things. Personally, if I were to take your course, I'd want to see Bayesian deep learning and variational auto-encoders in there.

  
Also, it sounds to me like the first course you've described would've probably been taught at the undergraduate level, so I suspect it wouldn't be needed for graduate students.

I see your point about the first course being a bit basic. I agree with this, but the idea was that we don’t necessarily assume one knows how to code well. Additionally, being a statistics department, we have a lot of graduate students who come from other departments (say psychology or even food science) who would like to learn how to analyze their own data and want to build those coding fundamentals.

Heck, it seems fairly common for computational statistics papers to use VI for inference on their model followed by a comparison of parameter estimates with MCMC. My understanding is that they do this because MCMC has many well established, easy-to-interpret diagnostics to monitor convergence like traceplots and Rhat which VI simply doesn't have.

1i44h5v,m7sgio4,"this all makes perfect sense if you know what the model of softmax is. 

Lets start with the part about the difference. Softmax is a generalisation of the sigmoid. In the sigmoid, we care about the odds, so N1/N2, i.e., how often event 1 happens compared to event 2. if you take the log of it, you get the log odds log(N1)-log(N2). now, if you know that you take the log anyways, you can parameterize N1=exp(s1) and you get 

log(N1/N2)=s1-s2

since softmax([s1,s2])=[sigmoid(s2-s1),sigmoid(s1-s2))=[N1/(N1+N2),N2/(N1+N2)] this makes perfect sense.

now, why does the magnitude not matter? because we want to learn the probability of events, and the total amount of events should not matter for our model. Therefore, it should not make a difference whether we compare the odd ratio of events and the ratio of p1=N1/(N1+N2), and indeed p1/p2=N1/N2=exp(s1-s2). And as a result, the overall magnitude of s does not matter.

Why is it good that the softmax is never 0? Because it you think about the odds of two events, how many samples do you need to confirm that the probability of some event is actually 0? Exactly, infinite.

I was fitting a model to soft labels yesterday. The model output was passed through a softmax function and a cross-entropy loss. However, when trained, the models all collapsed to putting all the probability mass on a single output value (i.e., predicting a one-hot vector). I tried various things, such as adapting the learning rate, inspecting the probability distributions (which were reasonably balanced), adding label smoothing, and increasing model capacity. None of these things worked.

I finally solved the problem by adapting the loss function to punish larger errors (per output value). My model then trained successfully. Still, it bothers me, because I feel that my understanding of softmax or cross-entropy must be fundamentally flawed. I'd love to know why the output collapsed, in case anyone knows.

This feels like ripe ground for solving via a strong type system, however it's not really a type.. the type is just ""float"". I guess it's more akin to ""units"". Maybe systems like pytorch should take some inspiration from programming languages or libraries that do encode units in type information, it might be a way forward.


For instance if F.softmax could return a Tensor of subtype (unit) ""probit"", and emit a big warning or error if it's ever passed to.a function that expects ""logit""-type tensors such as CrossEntropyLoss().


Now types in Python are supposed to be just hints so maybe warnings and errors are overboard and you just want something that could be caught by mypy analysis. But everything is already a Tensor!

The problem is that in an nD probability vector we only need to know n-1 entries to know the last value due to the sum to 1 constraint. parameterisation with an nD vector therefore must have one superfluous dimension.

so do it like the sigmoid, just take an n-1D vector and append a 0, then compute the softmax on it.",9,1737222857.0
1i44h5v,m7tlb6n,"If your goal is to use something inside the neural network that feels nicer and you even think about the linear function, then there is a very simple solution to your problem:

G(s)=ReLu(log(softmax(s)))+alpha)

with

log(softmax(s)))=s-logsumexp(s)

so

G(s)=ReLU(alpha+s-logsumexp(s))

where you pick alpha>0 to define a cutoff value for log p. This function has 0<=G(s)<=alpha and of course you could normalize that. But it does not have any interpretation of log-odds anymore, that is destroyed by the alpha.

Beyond this, I disagree. But let me explain. We have that softmax is

p=F(N)=N/sum(N) #fulfills that p[i]/p[j]=N[i]/N[j]

softmax=F(exp(s)) #fulfills that 0<p<1

you are right that we could think about other parameterisations of N=g(s) where g is an elementwise function like typical NN non-linearities. shall we try some?

g(s)=s, the linear function: we no longer have p>=0 and also not p<=1 so that nonlinearity is only interesting as nonlinearity inside the NN. But whenever max(|s|)>> |sum(s)| we have exploding behaviour, since the result for s with sum(s)=0 is undefined - small changes in any s can lead to unbounded changes in p. This is not good for any neural network training. Eventually you will have a parameter/sample combination close enough to 0 for your gradients to explode. This holds for every elementwise g(s) that can produce both positive and negative values.

g(s) such that g(s)=0 is local minimum , for example g(s)=s*s or g(s)=abs(s) or g(s)=ReLU(s): This gives 0<=p<=1. It also means that d/ds_i F(g(s))=0 whenever s_i=0 (if it is not undefined). If you aim to use this at any point inside the neural network, then be very careful with ReLU and similar non-linearities, because you can get very easily trapped by sparse gradients. And log-likelihood training is not possible when using this to compute the probabilities for obvious reasons.

So, now we have looked at two problems: if you use a parameterisation that allows both positive and negative values, you risk explosion. if you use an even function you risk 0 gradients. If you want to circumvent both, you need a function that is not even and is always positive (or negative but the sign cancels anyways). People manage to this with proper initialisation for ReLU, so maybe you can geht it to work. But see below for the ReLU case

g>0, g monotonically increasing: These are functions of the form g(s)=c+int_{-inf}^s f(t) dt, f(t)>=0. There are infinitely many of those. But if you want to have an s_i such, that p_i=F(g(s))_i=0, then there must be an s with g(s)=0 and by definition of the function class, we have that g(s')=0 for all s'<=s. So for example the ReLu function. And then you get the issue that you have regions of the space that are undefined. If you do not want this, you need to look at the strictly monotonic increasing, positive functions. But those can only have 0 at s->-inf.

I think we are now through the most important function classes. It is clear that if we use F(N), we are severely limited in our choice. But the next larger function class needs to decide which entries are 0, like the G(s) above did. This becomes pretty arbitry because you need to decide on cut-off points.",11,1737217224.0

1i4fvqn,m7yhe8o,"Essentially a specialized, PDE-flavored NCA with partial domain knowledge built-in (advection, diffusion, damping) if I'm undertanding correctly ? Both revolve around local stencils, repeated unrolling, and emergent patterns. Have you thought about incorporating it into a language model to create a semantic VortexNet-Transformer hybrid in the embedding space rather than RGB? (which is my line of research with NCAs!) You run VortexNet steps as a pre-optimization pass on the context which is reshaped to be a spatial in 2D.

You can probably try it at home by using an existing decoder-only LLM, freeze all its parameters, and put a LoRA on it which quickly helps it to understand the new spatial arrangement of embeddings. Later, the decoder can be swapped out for a brand new with fewer parameters, and retrained again, this time smaller as a result of having syphoned out some of the semantic computation dynamics that the bigger original pre-trained decoder had crystallized from the original text dataset. i.e. we extract some of the platonic realism learned by the model into a different antecedant model, which simultaneously simplifies the decoder's job.

Ilya talked about compute efficiency recently. Augmenting a global integrator (the O(n^2) transformer) to equally benefti from local O(n) computation is certainly a great direction towards compute efficiency! If the VortexNet is trained well and is sufficiently deep, you would see things such as embedding a big code file, and it would optimize it to its absolute optimal representation until homeostatis, functions optimizing and improving themselves locally and propagating like waves so that they're use elsewhere in the file also reflects that, until the whole file is converged on an optimal micro-representation with far fewer tokens to represent the ""vibe"" of the code which the decoder can now easily ""denoise"" into the causal textual representation. A pure NCA-Transformer LLM might capture more degrees of freedom, but the the built-in domain knowledge of a VortexNet-Transformer might instead train more easily and produce results faster in this constrained dynamic. Or alternatively it'd be incorporated in a joint-training scheme which helps rapidly bootstrap the NCA with this constrained dynamic before relaxing to just the NCA which can specialize additional degrees of freedom for greater expressivity.

Of course in VortexNet, each cell is only 1 or 2 channels (like a velocity field). If each cell can have thousands of channels (embedding dimension), then simply adding PDE stencils for each dimension might be huge. Possibly you can do a bottleneck: map from 3000 to a smaller PDE space (like 64 channels), run PDE steps, map back to 3000.",1,1737279536.0

1i3t4c3,m7pz78p,"> How does it adapt to item use?

Item use isn't so bad.  These are just extra actions the agent can take.  The problem is getting the agent the right rewards and enough practice with them.  I was able to train a model to use bombs fairly effectively, but it ended up using them too often.  (IE I knew when to use them for huge effect, but it didn't know when *not* to use them.)  That's a fixable problem, but takes a LOT of time to shape the rewards right.

Now that I have action masking working, it's a lot easier to train the model to use them effectively.  IE, I can tell the neural network during training ""no you cannot even choose to use bombs, there's nothing within 10 pixels of you (or whatever)"", or force the model to try out bombs when there's 3+ enemies nearby to obtain massive rewards every time...

Once it learns from that, you can then remove those hard masks allowing it to make mistakes in either a future training session (essentially fine tuning the model) or just when it plays the game so that you aren't cheating by telling it what to do.

In short, this is basically what I'm working on now.  My codebase is ready to start teaching it to use items, but one step at a time...

> Also those invisible walls and block pushing

This falls into the category of ""imagine your older sibling is telling you what to do in this room"" (or playing with a game guide, few people beat zelda1 without a guide of some sort).

Bombable walls and pushable blocks are actually onscreen items as far as the game is concerned!  If I get that far to need to get the model to use those, I would add them as an item/enemy/projectile/object/whatever saying ""hey, there's something here"" but the model would have to figure out how to bomb it or push it.

It's definitely a solvable problem, but I've had my hands full just with the rest of the game, so it hasn't been a priority yet.",3,1737158995.0

> How long did it take to get to 5 million training steps?

It greatly varies, but I'd say *generally* it takes about 45-90 minutes to get 500,000 steps.  My original version of the project had 5 separate models trained in the 10-40 million range, so that's about a week or more of calendar time for the FULL thing.  However, the old version would have okay results at 2 million, good results at 10, and micro improvements up to 40-50 million and stop getting better.

So I could do most of my development with a 1-2 million model (2-6 hours of training, ish) and make really good progress.  Training those super long runs were only done after I had something really solid working, then I let it run for a lot longer and checked if it was better.  The new model seems to hit okay at 300,000 and good at 1 million...but it's not getting as far into the game yet, so that might not hold true long term.  Having it train faster would be a huge benefit to making more progress on the project.

> Any insights on longer training runs?

For me these longer runs are all about keeping track of what it's doing so I don't waste a week on a bad run.  My tensorboard is nuts.  I have a metric for literally every reward/punishment, total rewards, a ""score/progress"" on how far the model is getting, stats about difficult rooms, etc.

The training process saves a model every 50,000 to 500,000 steps depending on what I'm doing.  So when I see things aren't training in a similar way to the last good run on tensorboard, I'll load up those checkpoint models in my reward debugger and try to figure out what it's stuck on.  (The reward debugger is the GUI I built that you see in the video.)

Load up the checkpoint where rewards or progress started regressing and usually you'd see PPO have exploited some bug in my rewards, or found some odd corner case I didn't account for and go off the rails.

Once I got something working, I'd tend to try to make small to medium size changes (not huge ones) and start a training run.  I'd see if it learned similar to the previous run while I worked on the next set of changes.  If not, I'd stop what I was doing and go work on why my last changeset didn't work.

Really it was an exercise in patience and damage control more than anything else.  Having that reward debugger was INCREDIBLY important.",3,1737175900.0

I did all of this from watching youtube, and I paid for a few hours of coaching via Wyzant to get help once I got stuck using DeepQ learning when it wasn't working.  (PPO was the better choice it turns out.)  If there's a great book for using RL in practice (not just the math behind it), I'd love to know.

I will say that Stable-Retro is awesome, it's a gymnasium environment that can play Atari, Genesis, NES, etc games. And stable-baselines3 have excellent implementations of RL algorithms and policies.  You can jump start the process by wiring stable-baselines to Stable-Retro and putting a critic gym.Wrapper in between the two which inspects game state to provide rewards.

Most popular games have modding communities of some sort, which means they have [RAM](https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda/RAM_map) [maps](https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue/RAM_map) available, so you can just check ""what is my pokemon's health"" and the like without having to disassemble the ROM.

Just to play with a project and get started, you should be able to take a game with a ram map and push the character to move forward in the level within a few hours.  Just remember to reward more for going forward than you punish for moving backwards.  In my case, using +0.05 and -0.06 rewards/punishments worked, whereas having them be equal did not.

This is what I originally thought too!  Or that I'd be focused on more long-term planning, not getting Link through each individual room.

What I learned is there's a better way to think of RL:  Reinforcement Learning will **brutally** optimize whatever reward function it's given.  Nothing more and nothing less.

For simple environments, simple rewards will work great and the GAMMA reward backpropagation will take care of the rest.  For more complicated environments, you have to do more complicated things.

For example, trying to invent the successors to transformers.
* You are an ***Engineer*** (software engineer, electrical engineer, MLE, etc) if you are designing a useful solution to a novel problem.  Usually by applying science that was invented by scientists -- and getting it implemented along with programmers. Note that [""engineering"" is derived from the latin ""ingenium"", meaning cleverness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering).

* You are a ***Programmer*** if you are mostly writing programs to specs written by someone else, like your product marketing department, or some API documentation.  For example (re)implementing an exact transformer model from a paper.
* You are an ***Analyst*** if you are crunching numbers and presenting summaries of data to people who want to act on that data.   For example, using a transformer model someone else programmed to gain insights from your data.
* You are an ***Operations*** guy (MLOPS, DEVOPS) if you're taking code and figuring out how scale it, or serve it reliably, or cost reduce it.

\- timing is not clear, for each auto regressive step of the transformer you can have controlling loop to update:

1. Once per each token

2. more often - many times per token until it gets a desired output

3. less often like when controlling loop somehow measures the gist of the recent conversation and changes the transformer weights only once every phrase/paragraph/conversation/etc..

\- What is the computational and memory overhead of the controlling network. How does it improve (or penalizes) the performance of the base network in terms like can it learn with less training data, or does it generalize better or does it needs more compute/memory or less?

Your original post makes it seem like each input sample has multiple labels. For example, if you were working with images, each image has more than one correct label.

1i31dwr,m7j5tol,"## Motivation

Hey everyone! I’ve been tinkering with a script to generate synthetic GSM problems for training and testing LLMs, and I am hoping they can be used to improve reasoning and analytical skills of open source models.

I feel like we should have many more tools for open-source synthetic training data, specially for training reasoning. Right now, I'm betting SOTA AI teams have their own tools for creating synthetic training data, but I wanted to create something that’s open source. When I tested an earlier version of my script, I noticed that while ChatGPT and Claude performed well, most open weights LLMs performed badly on my GSM-style problems, specially when the complexity is turned up a few notches. This was surprising because GSM is considered ""solved"" and benchmarks are considered saturated. Clearly, there’s room to improve here.

Why GSM? Even though GSM are simple problems by definition, solving GSM displays various model capabilities like following reasoning chains and interpreting data correctly.

## LLM performance

Typical similar GSM problems have 2-3 rows of data, with only a few references to other data. I can generate any number of rows (well currently upto 12).

Even ChatGPT 4 and Claude struggle with more than 7-8 rows of data, and smaller/open weight LLMs fail for smaller problems. Specially Llama 70B, LLama 8B and Gemma 27B failed with problems 5 rows or above.

DeepSeek-v3 seems to perform well actually with even 10 rows of data, though it needed a lot of tokens. There are a few other models in LMArena that are good at this, like Gremlin, Tippu etc. They are not available in direct chat so its hard to test them directly.

I am mostly testing in LMArena, did not want to spend money to put the models through the grinder yet. I am still finding out what works and what not. Eg 30 mins before this post I found out that the prompt ""Treat this problem like a complex puzzle. Solve carefully step by step"" improved performance on some models. Also using terms like ""3x the amount"" trips up some LLMs (like ChatGPT 4o).

But the point stands, that if people wanted to train LLama 8B to be better at similar problems, there is no synthetic, configurable, infinite dataset to train on. (That I could find, if you know please send me links.)

## What My Problems Look Like

[Here is a example](https://github.com/dattasid/grade-school-math-procedural/blob/main/datasets/examples/price_normal.md).

[Here is a example](https://github.com/dattasid/grade-school-math-procedural/blob/main/datasets/examples/price_easy.md) which uses simpler language, for testing if it is the confusing language that causes a model to fail.

The problems are about people buying stuff over several days. For example:

On Monday they buy 2 items for $3 each, On Tuesday they buy twice that of Monday for half the price. On Wednesday, ...you get the idea.

You might have to calculate total money spent, or figure out prices/quantities for a specific day.

Part of the complexity is figuring out relationships like, ""On Tuesday, you bought twice the amount as Wednesday for three times the price of Monday."" Note that we reference two different days, so the model must pay attention and substitute the correct values.

The problems also use forward references, like to solve amounts and prices for Tuesday you need Wednesday’s info which not given until later. Sometimes this will trip up the model, which will hallucinate some data after 1-2 steps of backtracking.

## Why not generate using LLMs

In my experience, LLMs are not very good at randomness. They will have a lot of trouble when asked to create a problem with a lot of rows, and when asked to tweak parameters such as number of dependencies. Also it will be difficult to have special properties eg: Problems generated by my script will never have approximate solutions.

I tried using LLMs to rephrase the problems generated by the script. But the LLMs always tried to make the problem simpler and easier to understand, that is against the goal here.

## Easy vs Normal Problems

My initial code varies each data as much as possible to make each problem as confusing as possible. Later I wanted to test if this is indeed challenging for LLMs, so I made the problems easy by changing only the presentation.

Easy Problems are have numerical data presented in predictable patterns.
Normal Problems mix it up with numbers presented in many formats such as ""$2,"" ""2 dollars,"" or even ""two dollars."" Language varies, and the phrasing can trip up models

o1 pointed out phrases like ""3x the amount"" is confusing. That was weird as humans easily understand this refers to the unknown `x` or just means 3 times. I am personally seeing in some problems with only 5 rows that GPT-4o failed to do before, can do now when '3x' is changed to '3 times'.

Note that

1. Each problem can be solved without algebra.
1. Each problem can be solved with integers. Prices are always multiple of .25, .50 or .10 . So there will never be approximate answers.

## Why These Problems Matter

I don’t think these problems measure ""intelligence"" or complex reasoning per se. These problems are too simple and formulaic. In my opinion, they are testing complex comprehension in RAG like setting. If the data is messy, disorganized, and in mixed format, can an LLM still piece it together?

Humans can solve these pretty easily once they get the hang of it. You just:

1. Write down the facts clearly. Because ""On Sunday, Phichai paid 6 dollars per item. Phichai spent a total of three Thousand seventy two dollars."" is difficult to parse if you have re-read it multiple times.
 ""Sunday price = $6. Total spent = $3072."" is easier to read.
1. Find out data with concrete numbers. Eg Sunday price = $6.
1. Find out data that depends on data we found out. Eg find out rows that refer to price of Sunday. And so on.
1. Continue until entire problem is solved.

A human can do by this reading the problem (or the simpler version they wrote down) again and again.

LLMs should be able to do this too since they ""re-read"" the problem for every token they generate. There’s even a great talk from a Meta scientist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBL7J0kgldU) that touches on this.

## Future work

I hope at some point to fine-tune a LLaMA 8B LORA with these problems and solutions and see if I can boost its performance. Since the solutions are synthetic, I can easily tweak the structure (direct, backtracking) and language (concise, verbose) to test what works best.

Currently I can create upto 12 rows of data (for 12 months). I can extend it to 30 using days of months but I have to check if the language is clear enough.

I can make the problems much more complex, or create more types of problems.
Eg:

1. Add unnecessary data eg a different person on a unrelated shopping spree.
1. Data about items that are unnecessary. Eg 5 items were bad (they were bought already so nothing changes)
1. Data can depend on multiple other data. (Eg Amount Sunday is sum of amounts on Monday and Tuesday)

1i2l0ey,m7mk188,"I've been thinking about something along these lines, even amongst ideas that are already well established. Sortof an agentic 'find the best model design given this dataset and problem' where it could actually run some light training itself with a reduced slice of the dataset until it finds some good looking results. Probably too expensive for the near term, but fascinating that it's feasible at face value with current tech.

Heck, with the new scheduled tasks feature and a custom gpt you could probably even automate this to give you the highlights of AI papers published to arxiv.

I'm happy to share the initial o1 output, which I ended up customizing a bit more for my present implementation (specifically adding in some additional logic to deal with gradient updates when self.training is True). This first output had a lot more details in comments that got lost during refinement though so I figure it is the best one to share. As for my prompt, it was a pretty straightforward 'this is a recent research paper, provide an implementation for me that incorporates the learnings into a working pytorch module' along with as much as the research paper as I felt was necessary for it to understand (basically everything up to the Conclusion, but not including references etc).

I am no data scientist, but from my layperson perspective it appears to have incorporated a good chunk of what is being described in the paper. I guess if we wanted to be more academic about this, it would make sense to try adding the same component to a barebones CNN + benchmark classification dataset to see if it has a similar positive impact on training metrics. I've also got plans for today to try and spend some time observing what impact the module actually has on training and inference. On the same token the paper does indicate a plan to release some code soon so we can probably just wait it out.

- train a KNN classifier with these embeddings. predict new text based on n=3/5/7/9 etc.

-train an XGB classifier if you have a lot of data tagged already for NSFW/SFW.


- compute ""average"" embeddings for both classes, which are just the mean embeddings of the class' data. Compare the text you want to predict with these two embeddings using dot product/cosine. Pick the class whose avg embedding is most similar to the text.

Encoders like BERT are trained to use both left and right context, and to predict words at any position in the input. The learning forces it to learn a broader embedding that captures the entire sentence's meaning to be able to do that any-position prediction well.

This is not precisely accurate and different encoders than BERT exist, but hopefully you get the gist.",17,1737031660.0

1i2h315,m7g1m3s,"Got it, so to summarize my high level understanding:

With unmasked attention, if we take a phrase like ""the biggest whales in the casino"", the token ""whales"" can attend ""casino"", and therefore (very roughly speaking, of course) be understood directly as ""high rollers"". With masked attention, ""whales"" can't attend the future token ""casino"" so it will probably be understood to mean ""giant sea mammal"", and any recontextualization has to be awkwardly crammed into the model's understanding of ""casino"" (or some future token(s)).

So obviously masked attention trades off comprehension, but it's worth it for generation, because among other things, unmasked attention would mean that during inference, we'd have to recompute _everything_ to give previous tokens a chance to attend each newly generated token. Masked attention prevents that, so we can just reuse the previous computations.

But that advantage goes away if you're talking about classification, because you're not doing a long sequence of inference steps. You're doing a single step, so there's no point in trying to make computations reusable. So using masked attention for classification would just be throwing away comprehension power for no benefit.",5,1737033487.0

Relatedly, are you allow to use pooling? That’s downsampling down to smaller sizes and forcing the MLP to learn from just those downsampled features. There is adaptive pooling in addition to (or instead of) vanilla max and avg pooling.

1i2lk5n,m7rg943,"This is the summary made with the tool using Deepseek V3:

1. The main topic: The paper introduces PMIT-S0L, a tool for inferring Stochastic Context-Free Lindenmayer systems (S0L-systems) from a sequence of strings generated by a hidden L-system. S0L-systems are used to model natural and engineered processes, and PMIT-S0L aims to automate the creation of these models, which is currently a manual and expert-dependent process.



2. Existing problems: Current approaches to inferring S0L-systems rely on aesthetics or a priori expert knowledge, making the process inefficient and limited. Additionally, there is a lack of research on inferring S0L-systems compared to deterministic L-systems (D0L-systems), and the problem is complicated by the non-uniqueness of solutions and the stochastic nature of S0L-systems.



3. The main contributions: The paper presents PMIT-S0L, which uses a greedy algorithm hybridized with search algorithms (brute force search and genetic algorithm) to infer S0L-systems. This approach significantly improves over previous methods, achieving 100% success in inferring S0L-systems with up to 12 rewriting rules when using brute force search. The tool is domain-agnostic and does not require a priori knowledge, making it applicable to a wide range of modeling scenarios.



4. Experimental results: PMIT-S0L was evaluated on 3600 procedurally generated S0L-systems with up to 9 symbols and 14 rewriting rules. The brute force search variant achieved 100% success for systems with up to 12 rewriting rules within a 4-hour time limit, while the genetic algorithm variant performed less effectively, especially with more than 7 rewriting rules. The success metric was based on finding an S0L-system with at least as high a probability of producing the input strings as the original hidden L-system.



5. Conclusions: PMIT-S0L is a practical and reliable tool for inferring S0L-systems, particularly when using brute force search. It opens up new possibilities for modeling processes in various research domains without requiring expert knowledge. Future work should address limitations such as successor prefixes, explore more efficient search algorithms, and extend the tool to handle multiple observed sequences of strings.

1i2lk5n,m7j0ayb,"You're welcome. I was curious how this tool would summarize it. I have yet to see an AI tool that can provide a good summary. They are always vague and unclear, but I don't think the OP is coming back.",2,1737065487.0
1i2lk5n,m7rgmwi,"I asked it about the question, here is the response:  
  
  
In this paper, L-systems (short for Lindenmayer systems) are described as a formal grammar system used for modeling processes, particularly in biological and geological contexts. They are a type of parallel rewriting system that generates sequences of strings based on a set of rules. These strings can then be interpreted as symbolic instructions to create visual models, often used in simulation software.

Key Components of L-systems:

1. Alphabet (V): A set of symbols that form the building blocks of the system.
2. Axiom: An initial string (or word) over the alphabet, which serves as the starting point for the rewriting process.
3. Rewriting Rules (P): A set of rules that specify how each symbol in the alphabet can be replaced by another string. For example, a rule like A → AB means that every occurrence of the symbol A in a string is replaced by AB.

Types of L-systems:

1. Deterministic Context-Free L-systems (D0L-systems): Each symbol has exactly one rewriting rule. For example, A → AB means that every A is always replaced by AB.
2. Stochastic Context-Free L-systems (S0L-systems): Each symbol can have multiple rewriting rules, each associated with a probability. For example, A → AB : 60% and A → BB : 40% means that A is replaced by AB 60% of the time and by BB 40% of the time.

How L-systems Work:

* Derivation Step (⇒): In each step, every symbol in the current string is rewritten in parallel according to the applicable rules. This process is repeated iteratively to generate a sequence of strings.
* Interpretation: The resulting sequence of strings can be interpreted as instructions for simulation software, often used to model processes like plant growth, protein folding, or geological formations.

Applications of L-systems:

* Plant Modeling: L-systems have been particularly successful in modeling plant growth, where symbols represent parts of the plant (e.g., stems, branches) and the rules describe how these parts grow and branch over time.
* Other Domains: They have also been used to model biological processes, geological formations, and even to generate training data for computer vision tasks.

Challenges with L-systems:

* Inference Problem: One of the main challenges discussed in the paper is the difficulty of inferring the correct L-system (especially S0L-systems) from a given sequence of strings. This is typically done manually by experts, which is time-consuming and requires a priori knowledge.
* Stochastic Nature: S0L-systems introduce additional complexity because the same initial string can lead to different outcomes due to the probabilistic nature of the rules.

In summary, L-systems in this paper are a formal grammar system used for modeling processes through parallel rewriting rules, with a focus on stochastic systems (S0L-systems) that incorporate probabilities into the rewriting process. The paper introduces a tool, PMIT-S0L, to automate the inference of S0L-systems from observed sequences of strings, addressing the challenges of manual rule creation.",1,1737180396.0

   * 90% of all queries are complete in <= 1 second
   * 99% of all queries are complete in <= 5 seconds

I would say one of the first areas I would recommend you spend some time researching and studying would be what is known as **E**xtract **T**ransform **L**oad or ETL for short. This is a system in which you *extract* data from a source like a database or the payload in packets of network traffic, you then *transform* the data into a nice ""structured"" format that will be useful for later search queries, and then you *load* that data into a database for those later queries.

Usually part of what makes the ""Big"" in ""Big Data"" is the volume of machines you're using in the business. The most common approach is to use **Hadoop** which provides a distributed filesystem across multiple machines. In order for Hadoop to make sense, you first need as a prerequisite to learn about **distributed systems** and the common design patterns used here.

To give you a little bit of a primer, here are some things to expect to see in distributed systems and Hadoop in particular:

1. There is usually one main NameNode at a time which acts as the ""leader"" in the distributed system. For fault tolerance (meaning the ability to withstand the application temporarily breaking and being able to quickly recover without human intervention), two more NameNodes will be used. The concept of who is the leader is maintained through continuous ping messages between each NameNode. This is typically referred to as a ""heartbeat"". If the leader goes quiet for a period of time, it will be assumed to be dead and a fallback leader is elected.

2. DataNodes access the actual data i.e. they know how to find the appropriate inodes for a file and on which machines those inodes exist. If you don't know about inodes yet, you will need a course on operating systems and will learn about it in a section on filesystems. The DataNodes are selected by the NameNode when a query is submitted to the leader NameNode.

3. JournalNodes are the actual processes that send the previously mentioned ""heartbeats"". They also ensure that the file metadata is copied between NameNodes in the event that the leader node fails.

  
Instead of Hadoop you may also come across **Kafka** which is a distributed message queue. The idea of a message queue is an intermediate machine takes on the responsibility of holding onto, delivering, and optionally verifying that the message sent gets delivered to the intended destination (i.e. a database). 

A message queue like *Kafka* is divided into two main concepts: *Producers* and *Consumers*. A third component -- The ""message broker"" -- ensures that all requests between producers and consumers is delivered or otherwise keeps track of failures. 

Message queue architectures can also provide a **Q**uality **O**f **S**ervice level or QoS for short. This means ""fire and forget the packet"", ""ensure that the packet gets delivered to at least one consumer"", or ""ensure that the packet gets delivered to one and only one consume"".

1hkkq2k,m3g0yf8,"So one of the customers I work with that I've been working with for over a decade now also has an on-prem requirement, similar scale and setup to what you are talking about. 

Not going to lie, we've looked at alternatives through the years and haven't found much better. We've tested storing data minio and using the S3 API and tooling it was generally slower for most of our use cases we tested and we also didn't want to add yet another piece of infrastructure to maintain. Also we moved to erasure encoding by default on our production data in HDFS which actually improved performance in many cases and worst case made some things just a tiny bit slower but allowed us to reclaim 50% of our storage.


For compute we still have lots of mapreduce jobs that were written years ago running in YARN because it just works! They still meet our requirements and the dev teams know how to work with things since that's what's been there for years. We have had hive for a long time and it's still used heavily, because it just works. We've added spark scheduled via YARN for more data science/analysts type work since it's more flexible. Most of the spark stuff is done in Python.

There is some interest in looking at a few things but we haven't done it yet:
- Spark in K8s
- Trino
- Iceberg tables


For that client they've already paid the cost to learn how to use and manage that stack so although the leadership is willing to let us engineers experiment unless there is a truly compelling reason to make a change they will generally just stick with what they know. Is this the sink cost fallacy? Perhaps, but many times the added complexity isn't worth it for what usually isn't a substantial benefit.",3,1734966334.0

1i4nlb2,m7wydub,"Do you want to continue as a data analyst? If yes, then I don't think masters will give you the advantages you are hoping for.

Your promotions won't come from having a masters, your work at said company is the only thing that's going to be relevant.

There is some benefit to having a masters for future job prospects, but 2 years of work experience will be just as valuable as 2 years of masters.

If you want to change your profile (become a product manager etc.), then an MBA is useful, if you want to stay as a data analyst, you'd be better served continuing to work at your company. You may be able to jump up a level if you have an MBA from a reputed college, but you should weigh the amount of money you'll have to spend to get the MBA vs the amount you'd make if you just kept earning.",17,1737255237.0
1i4nlb2,m7xeddf,"Go with whatever is the most affordable. For senior roles that require 5-10 YoE, a master's degree really just becomes a ""checkbox"" *most* of the time.

There are a few exceptions, like statistician roles in pharma where an MS in Statistics (or Biostatistics) is a hard requirement. In contrast, the managers and senior DS in my company have all sorts of master's degrees: econ, data science, public policy, and even mechanical engineering. If the programs with which you are interested roughly cost the same, I recommend either (applied) statistics or economics by process of elimination:
1. CS: most master's programs worth their salt expect an undergrad in CS, or that you have taken intro-to-intermediate CS classes (e.g., data structures). A quantitative undergrad like math/stats alone isn't enough without a handful of CS coursework.
2. (Applied) Math: too much theory than you would reasonably need. This is desirable in a handful of fields like finance (quant) and operations research. In the overwhelming majority of cases, you'd find just as great success with a less challenging program like stats/econ.
3. MBA: you don't learn that much hard skills, so the pedigree and prestige is what you're really getting. For better or worse, ""top"" MBA programs are stupidly expensive. Nowadays, industry experience can compete with MBA grads in my opinion. This is especially true for management/senior roles in data analytics/science. You need not only be able to navigate multiple stakeholders, but also know the tech stack well enough to manage your team.

Regarding 1: if you think you can handle a graduate CS program and get admission to one, then go for it. A master's in CS will make you a more ""well-rounded"" data professional in contrast to stats/econ.

I have lots of friends that made a great career managing large SQL instances for banks, mortgage, real estate, e-commerce and pharma companies. You can look into this and get training and certifications to get started.

SQL is a query language used by all relational databases - each database product (like Postgres or MySQL) implements extensions to the SQL standard or has implemented some features differently. 

Other companies are relying on cloud based solutions, like managing BigQuery databases, but I'm less familiar with those but I do know having SQL experience helps you be good at this as well. BigQuery is a requirement to leverage Google's Machine Learning tools, so it might help to look into this.

1i3tyno,m7rpt0j,"Yes, this falls under ""data reporting"" (descriptive statistics; data visualization): the most common type of data analytics with the lowest barrier to entry. Roles that use SQL + a data visualization tool also fall under data reporting. 

No, this isn't gonna directly lead to data science but you can use this experience to pivot to (senior) analyst role that involve 
- statistical modeling using Python or R (think regressions, A/B testing, quasi-experimental methods, etc.);
- or SQL.

Then, you can eventually break into data science. A lot of data science roles really only do A/B testing rather than ""machine learning"" and ""AI."" 

In the next year, find a role that involves SQL. LinkedIn influencers overestimate the value of soft skills in landing analytical roles.

1i2wbgh,m7jypj7,"Okay, so I actually did the Cert and I’m in the industry, so here’s my take!

It’s truly not useful. The SQL that I learned in the course, I took another course to learn it more in depth. Same with R. After finishing it, I was hoping to get jobs from it, but nothing. However, it did look good on my resume to get into GT’s Analytics Master’s program. I then worked for free (yes, free) at someone’s small little startup company to get more experience in Python and Git. Finally, I got a job after over a year at a really nice company. 

If I were to go back, I don’t think I’d do it again. I would certainly watch a few videos on what the certification tells you, because it does provide insight on what to expect and what data analysis even is. Grind your skills on SQL, Python, and Google Sheets functions, and then I would try to find a job that works alongside analytics if not directly, so that you can see what your coworkers are doing, and maybe get involved internally. I would also recommend taking EdX MicroMasters courses. 

With data analysis, it is definitely way too oversaturated, but to get an edge over others, learning modeling, ML, and data science will put you above others. This will involve deeper understanding of statistics, calculus, and other math. 

In conclusion, try to learn it in the workplace, not academically. Express to your manager that you want more responsibilities but with a role more focused on Excel or data. Then later, hone the math skills. I hope this makes sense!",17,1737076712.0

Yes, I agree with this conclusion. The purpose of using SQL for data analysis and analytics is mainly just to get the data out of the database.

In math, we have expressions. Like “2 + 2 = 5” or “All cyclic groups are abelian,” which discuss mathematical objects. We noticed that those expressions themselves can be thought of as mathematical objects. We developed mathematics to formalize and discuss 

* how those expressions are constructed (syntax)

* what it means for those expressions to be true or false (semantics)

Later, some mathematicians, linguists, and philosophers observed that expressions in natural languages can also be realized as formal objects, and a lot of that work on the formal syntax and semantics of mathematics can be applied to them, as well. The reason that was particularly interesting is that there are logical phenomena in natural languages that aren’t so common in mathematics. We often say things like “I might go to the store” or “tomorrow I will go to the store,” where the truth value of the expression relies on the way the world could be, or the way the world will be at some other point in time.

After that learn some python. Absolute basics of data structures and manipulating data. Learn to pull in data from a csv or json file. Call a Python script from the command line. This should take 3-5 hours. 

Don’t go too deep. The goal for these first two steps is just learning to interact with your machine. 

IMO SQL is most important for analysts, but it can be a bit confusing to jump into a database without any idea how it interacts with the computer it’s situated in. When I started in analytics, I had 0 experience and my manager was telling me to ssh into another machine and run a query to pull down some data. I had no idea you could even interact with a computer via the command line, let alone how to get data out of a database on a totally different computer and into a csv file on my machine. It was overwhelming.

By this stage I think you’re well set up to start on SQL. There’s no limit on how deep to go here—anything you learn will be helpful in your career.

At some point you will know how to do most things with most tools just by learning them in a different tool. I'm pretty decent in Excel, for example, and I didn't get Power Query until I figured out SQL, which I got to by finally understanding Power BI.

If I'm doing ad hoc things, they don't particularly care what I use because I just need to visualize it and explain it. If I'm collabing with others then it usually just defaults to what they know and can use, and that's honestly usually just Excel.

Instead of trying to do everything within a tool, try to learn the things you'll need to do with all the tools.

1i2nnud,m7gdjv5,"Listen, I understand you’re frustrated, but like the comment above you said, if you have really truly gotten face time with someone for 40 different roles, you are doing something wrong. From what I’ve gathered here, you’re putting a lot of emphasis on things that your interviewers probably do not care about at all, like pandas syntax. I have been working in this field for half a decade and I still to this day have to refresh myself on the exact syntax is for things like .loc, .groupby,  .sort_values, etc. it’s not uncommon at all and anyone in this sub who tells you they know the syntax for every core pandas function is lying or has a scarily spongy brain. 

Everyone starts in this predicament: I have no experience but I have skills and I am ready to apply them but I require experience to get hired but how do I acquire that without anyone hiring me

Somehow, some way, people find their way around this, though. I wish I had better advice for you other than “keep going” but I don’t, that’s just what must be done. If you want to start thinking about how to change your strategy, the best place to start is with your interviewers that have rejected you. I would hope you have been reaching out to each one to gather feedback on your interviewers performance that you can learn from and carry into the next. If you have not been doing that, by god you have to start. 

My final word of advice would be this: you have the skills, but so does everyone else in the applicant pool and there’s a high chance someone has better technical skills than you. What I have noticed when hiring, is that these people tend to do the least research on the company, the industry within which it sits, and how that role contributes to its business vertical.

My undergrad career center will perform mock interviews to give folks practice.  Maybe yours will as well?

As for the studying part, if you’re telling me that you don’t have time to study the business and also do their technical assignments throughout the candidacy that is indicative to me that you’re doing too many candidacies in rapid fire succession. Slow down, treat every opening like it’s the only job in the world. If you’re not employed right now, you should have nothing but time. I see Leetcode talked about a lot here and I think they’re ridiculous and stupid to be honest. When I deliver technical assignments during interviews they are very much focused on applying the technical skills not grilling you on syntax. Generally I’d stay away from the kinds of positions that just hammer you with code assignments. The job is more than that. 

I’d also look for roles in areas that don’t traditionally leverage analytics. Analytics in places like marketing, sales, etc are cutthroat and saturated. If you poke into corners like compliance, risk, internal audit (if a publicly traded company), finance, etc. and look at analytics roles that exist inside those cost centers rather than revenue generating areas of the business, you may have more success breaking in.

Dynamic pricing is more effective for companies with a centralized pricing strategy. For example, Amazon has been able to utilize this strategy because their customers converge on a single platform. 

For companies with location based pricing strategy, is it rather a complicated process. A good option is to create a sort of pricing standardization by categorizing their customers according to their locations (metro, urban, sub-urban etc.) assuming stores in each locations have similar pricing strategy.

Once we do this, then we easily carry out the price optimization experiment by targeting the three location segments separately.

I work for a small mental health agency, and our IT department is smaller and less developed. I am the “Data Analyst” in the IT department, but since we only have a couple hundred end users who need administrative reports, we don’t have the need for system admins and engineers who have a nuanced and deep understanding of relational databases and ETL processes. 

For dataset preparations and integrations, I do SQL and T-SQL and for pipelines we use a hybrid approach between Microsoft fabric in power bi service and a data gateway from the on prem sql server and the semantic models on power vi service. I then do the surface level reporting — both visually and tabular. Neither the data engineering aspect or BI development aspect is too complex.

1i1lu49,m7bi1q2,"Wow coming in with the hard questions.

I think the best thing to do is be skeptical of anything you’re told and set up checks to monitor the tables you use.

By skeptical I mean.  Just because someone says that some set of columns should be a primary key you should check.  Often upstream tables can be changed and that affects other tables in unforeseen ways.  

You should also be skeptical of yourself.  We are all way dumber than we think.  If there is a source that is accepted as the truth and you can compare an example from there to an example in your query result you should check.

Whenever possible store keys from source table instead of values from dimension tables.  The country name for turkey got changed and a whole bunch of stuff that had the country name stored got f’ed for my team.  It took weeks to straighten everything out across all tables.

Dates should be dates not strings and dates are the most likely thing to be wrong.  If a date is system generated it’s probably fine, but any date that was human entered or derived in a query is suspect. Time zones are very hard and people will make weird choices.  For example apparently Amazon set lots of dates to pacific time when stored rather than local or gmt.  So lots of queries have stupidly complicated work arounds (source I know someone who works there).

I don’t know if there are good datasets out there for this.  I think most stuff that’s available publicly gets sanitized, but internal politics at companies mean stupid choices don’t get fixed.",6,1736968060.0

1i18boz,m74fzld,"In reality (depends on your organization) most work can be split into the following categories: 
- building dashboards
- ad hoc analytics (business questions, this is dropping please find out why)
To get there you may take a range of approach and tools (again depends on your organization and what tech stack is available. How mature data culture is.)",3,1736873669.0
1i18boz,m74g31x,"It's all about your own interests. Excel is king and frankly a good Excel user can do just about everything an analyst will need to do (maybe throw in a data viz tool). SQL is extremely useful if it's a company that heavily uses a relational database, but Power Query can do most of the same stuff that SQL can do with a GUI instead of coding. 

As an example from my personal projects, I was interested in creating a unified track and field conversion calculator where inputting a time and distance would give you equivalent performances in standard events (and you could put in any intermediate distance, like 743m and convert it to an 800m time). I pulled data on various standard events, fit a nonlinear regression curve to it, and then used that equation to power a calculator. All of that was done in Excel.

Another example, I wanted to analyze the relationship between financial information (net spend, revenue, transfer fees, wages, etc.) and success (trophies, league position, etc.) of top 6 EPL clubs. This required pulling data on each of those variables, transforming it into tables with SQL, then visualizing each aspect in PowerBI, as well as some predictive modeling which was done with R (the visualizations were then added to PowerBI). So that used SQL, PowerBI, and R.",2,1736873697.0

A lot of the resources they used I could have learned for free. Even with the career coach, while they helped with building my resume and creating a job strategy, I could have gotten those resources for free through my public library (I live in the US).

I think if you have the discipline to self-study, it might be beneficial to go that route and then build project experience through volunteering opportunities where you can work with real data, freelance or develop your own side projects that you can showcase. Volunteering will also help to build your network since you'll be working with different individuals. Also, join data professional groups on LinkedIn, attend conferences, and do other activities to meet people.

1i1akf5,m76uiqq,"Of course! Honestly, I know I'm the type of person who needs structure and deadlines to hold me accountable, so the bootcamp was helpful in that sense. Outside of that, not too worth it. 

The data professional groups that I'm a part of on LinkedIn share different resources such as tips on how to use different analytic tools, best practices, webinars, sometimes job posts, and a chance to connect with others in the industry. There are probably different data professional groups outside of LinkedIn, which do the same. 

For volunteering, I've heard people using VolunteerMatch, Idealist,  Bluebonnet Data, and Statistics without Borders. Forage also has free ""internships"" where you can work with real data from companies with answers to the business problem being posed. You can also look to see if there are any events on meetup.com. I've seen different community groups hosting hackathons on there. I'm sure there are more opportunities available specific to your region, too. 

Although it may not necessarily be in the data analyst space, you could also use Lunchclub to network with people across different industries.

Then the application will hit the LinkedIn api search for all the postings with that job title grab all the required and preferred qualifications and basically make a general map of what's the popular tools in the market (dbt, airflow etc.). I can also map geolocation data where jobs are hot as well. Then there can be a scrolling function where you can go through the postings one by one if you want to just see them.

1i52gfe,m80t1fm,"1. Data from vendors/clients will have some degree of inconsistency over time, and those changes will be poorly documented, if at all. Relating to that, changes will happen in real time that you will not be informed of that will break your pipelines, so your pipelines and output need to be fault tolerant.  This one of the most frequent issues I deal with. 

2. Requirements will be poorly understood by both the asking party and the developer, while the desire for new stuff will be incessant. I have built multiple pipelines that go under/unutilized for months or even a year, and then suddenly they will want to go active with the data. Data that hasn’t been touched in a year WILL fall out of sync, and current expectations will not match prior year expectations. 

2. The interface between data creators and data consumers is always a friction point. That’s…actually both of the problems u mentioned before as well, but specifically you can have challenges when the data providers isn’t technical, but the data creator doesn’t really have the bandwidth to built an entire use friendly intuitive UI for someone to use a few times a month. You need to communicate requirements and expectations clearly here, and there will be technical challenges as you try to kludge together 3-4 different services to play nicely together. An example that. I regularly have to deal with is excel files generated by people that get sent to outlook, saved to s3, converted, and loaded into snowflake. There’s a lot of things that can go wrong here if the initial user does something funny with the column names, data types, tab names, file name, email subject, etc. experience with panda or polars will let you resolve most of these problems with minimal dev time, but it’s annoying and it’s bad publicity to have your pipelines fail often, no matter the root cause.",1,1737311151.0

1i4njkr,m7zbmvo,"A data pipeline should generally favor a Functional Programming (FP) style when dealing with simple data transformations and a focus on immutability, while an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach is better suited for complex data systems with multiple interacting entities, where you need to model real-world concepts with rich data structures and behaviors. 
Key points to consider when choosing between OOP and FP for a data pipeline:
Data immutability and pure functions:
If your pipeline primarily involves applying transformations to data without modifying the original data, FP with its emphasis on pure functions and immutability is often more efficient and easier to reason about.
Complex data relationships:
When your data pipeline needs to manage intricate relationships between different data entities, OOP can be advantageous by allowing you to encapsulate data and behavior within classes, creating a more structured model. 
When to use OOP in a data pipeline:
Modeling real-world entities:
If your data pipeline deals with complex business objects or concepts that have clear relationships, representing them as classes with defined properties and methods can improve code clarity. 
State management:
When your pipeline needs to maintain internal state across different stages, OOP can provide a structured way to manage this state within objects. 
Reusability and inheritance:
If you need to create reusable components with common functionalities, OOP allows you to leverage inheritance and polymorphism to avoid code duplication. 
When to use FP in a data pipeline:
Data transformations and aggregations:
When the primary focus is on applying functions to manipulate and process data, FP’s declarative style can lead to concise and readable code. 
Parallel processing:
Many functional programming paradigms are well-suited for parallel processing due to the nature of pure functions and immutability. 
Testing and debugging:
Functional code can be easier to test due to its predictable behavior and lack of side effects. 
Important considerations:
Hybrid approach:
Often, it’s beneficial to combine elements of both OOP and FP within a single data pipeline, using classes to structure complex data entities while leveraging functional techniques for data manipulation.

I know there is a bit of an echo chamber in here about a code only future and I get it. It's flexible, the ones that do it well are paid real well and it's where a lot of engineers want to take their careers. And if a company doesn't go that way then they don't know what they're doing etc

There are other factors though. Not all companies can manage teams of skilled engineers to do this at scale. Not only the cost of engineers but needing to build the engineering practices, DevOps, manage upgrades, security risks. Open source can be a blessing and a curse and managed solutions over open source can be even costlier than the integrated packages.

I'm noticing a lot of silicon valley startups want senior data engineers who can hit the ground running and develop all the basic data warehouse, ETL pipeline and analytical infrastructure by themselves. This usually requires showing you have 1) experience with the pace of a startup/motivation to keep up 2) you have experience with all the basic and modern ETL tools (airflow/dagster for scheduling, what a data lake is, dbt for data modeling, and data warehouse experience for basic analytics), and have had some experience with all parts of the ETL pipeline, since you're probably going to be the only one there.

Smaller companies outside the bay tend to avoid hiring someone in the bay area due to being worried about meeting the salary expectations.

Also, my job is to understand & solve problems, not waste time remembering syntax I can just look up… but every interview i’ve been in they don’t even let me look up documentation while I’m sharing my screen. 

I have a bad short-term memory and with the added stress of interviewing for a job that you need to pay your bills you’re more likely to make silly mistakes that make you look incompetent when you’re not.

Just as you have various virtual environments for Python it is worth learning how to build  a Docker container. I built one for Postgres with a few sample DBs in it purely to act as training resources. The next step was to adapt the container so any data persists, even if you destroy the container.
If I want to learn a data related technology without ending up in dependency hell I build a Docker image.

As a fair bit of DE is connecting to all sorts of sources and targets, the next step is to get different Docker containers to talk to each other.  Strictly speaking a DE probably won't need to know much about networking but it is damn useful to have in your back pocket.
A lot of what I know might not be explicitly DE but come debugging and diagnostic time what I know shines a light from many directions.

1. Strengthen Your SQL Skills Learn advanced querying and database design. SQL is the backbone of data engineering—focus on optimization and writing efficient queries.
2. Understand ETL/ELT Concepts Familiarize yourself with Apache Airflow for orchestration and DBT for transformations. Build a small project to get hands-on experience.
3. Learn Big Data Tools Dive into Apache Spark or PySpark for handling large datasets. Practice with sample data to get a feel for distributed computing.
4. Explore Cloud Platforms Pick one—AWS or GCP. Learn services like S3, Glue, Redshift (AWS) or BigQuery, Dataflow (GCP). Start with deploying small pipelines.
5. Learn Data Modeling Understand Star and Snowflake schemas. Practice designing data warehouses using tools like Snowflake.
6. Build Real-World Projects Create an end-to-end pipeline: extract data from APIs, transform it, and load into a warehouse like Snowflake or BigQuery.
7. Learn Streaming & Real-Time Processing Explore Kafka for data streaming and real-time projects.
8. Get Familiar with DevOps Learn Docker and CI/CD pipelines to understand deployment in real-world setups.

When it comes to a DB IDE, DBeaver community edition will let you play around.  There is are VS Code extensions that allow you to treat VS Code as an IDE that interacts with the DB.
I built my own PostGres image because I used that to put Nigel's teachings into practice.

2. Prefect has it’s on logger that you use in the orchestration code, when you go to the UI, either while the flows/tasks are running or when they finish, you can look at the logs.

1. **What we want to display**: The primary requirement is to have a dashboard where users can select a start and end date for a period and view analytics such as total cost, average cost per call, and the top 10 most expensive calls. Additionally, there’s an interest in implementing full-text indices to search within the responses of models for further insights.
2. **Time window for data**: The current time window spans two years, which corresponds to the platform's operational period so far. However, in practice, the scope includes all data from the beginning of platform usage.
3. **SLA expectations**: The stakeholders haven't provided a concrete SLA definition. Practically, near real-time processing would suffice. Since this dashboard will also monitor costs (e.g., costs of calls to the models), the acceptable margin of error is small.
4. **Data flow details**: The average peak at the moment is approximately 100 calls per second, but there is an expectation that this could increase significantly in the future. While they can’t provide precise growth estimates, they emphasize the need for a scalable solution.
5. **Scalability expectations**: Given their insistence on scalability, we’re considering implementing a more robust and potentially more expensive solution upfront to accommodate higher future loads.

1i48phw,m805ezh,"Let me reply back in two parts. 1) some thoughts on your answers and what I think they mean, and 2) what I think your approach should be.

Overall, I think u/ErichHS is right, your requirements aren't really what is normally construed as ""real-time"". It is more standard analytic needs. That is good news. The question you need to get answered from the business side is how long after an ""event"" do you need it to show up in the data? Know going in that they are going to say ""immediately."" That is very doable, but it isn't cheap. Don't get confused with what the business calls ""real-time"" and what the tech side calls ""real-time."" They are normally very different things. Lots of money has been spent by companies who did that. This is why you need to move away from that phrase and to SLAs as quickly as possible. I usually offer up timeframes starting at 1 day, 1 hour, 15 minutes, 15 seconds. Let them pick. If they pick any of those four, you are in batch to micro-batch territory. (Don't tell the business that, just acknowledge thier choice.) If they say anything less than 3 seconds, you are in streaming territory. Make sure they give you the use cases and business reasons requiring anything for streaming. You may want to remind them that costs for faster SLAs don't go up linearly.

Divide the project into two parts.

1. The design and deliverables you have to have right now. The design should be extensible. You don't have to implement everything up front. I would use this time to classify the data by SLA.
2. Nice to have stuff that will come in the future. For example, full text search is not a display thing, move it out of this section. Make it a phase 2 item.

**The feedback**

1. This is pretty straight forward, and it really doesn't require short SLA data.
2. With the amount of data you have this is not a problem. A reminder, as the data grows, the query costs with some databases will grow and the performance will decrease. Normally, more recent data is queried more than older data. You can use this to your advantage to reduce costs.
3. You are going to need SLAs for how long before each data type shows up after the event and SLAs for when the dashboard is ready. If the business can't give them to you, make them yourself and be kind to yourself. You will have enough challenges without giving yourself impossible or difficult SLAs.
4. (and 5)These are the same thing and you can approach it in a few ways. Your company may lean towards capital expenditures or operational costs.

* Only put in what you need as you go. Your finance guys will love you. It will probably be more expensive overall, but not that much more.
* Buy it all up front. You will have hardware sitting around and heating your server room for a while.
* Consider cloud design.  Get help for this.  Cloud architecture has to really concern itself with operational costs as opposed to capital. It also solves your bursting and growth issues.

Good luck. If you have any more questions, let me know.

One last thing, your vendors are not your partners. They will advise you on things that will make them the most money. Trust your own council when it comes to them. Keep asking yourself, ""whay are they doing this?""",2,1737304542.0

1i48phw,m809d6w,"u/marketlurker thank you so much for such a thoughtful and detailed response.

I think managed to get the business to accept a one-minute timeframe for changes to appear, which is a huge relief. This puts  it in micro-batch territory, as you pointed out. Estimating costs, however, is where I feel very lost. I’ve never done it before, and honestly, I doubt my bosses have a clear idea either.

One important detail I forgot to mention earlier is that the entire platform is already cloud-based (Azure, Mongo Atlas, and KAfka Confluent). I suspect this setup is already burning a significant amount of money in operational costs, but I don’t know how much. Their mantra has always been, “We need to be ready for when the platform is adopted by thousands of clients,” which makes me think some cost inefficiencies are being justified as future-proofing.

To summarize where we are now: we have microservices writing directly to Mongo. If I were to propose adding a separate OLAP system and an event queue (using Kafka, since it's already in our stack but not fully utilized), with micro-batches to populate the OLAP system, do you think that approach makes sense?

1i4d4nl,m7vnxgl,"If you think putting your script into a task will be huge and impossible to maintain, then I have news for you -- even without the task, your script is probably already huge and impossible to maintain. 

A big party of Airflow's value is being a distributed job scheduler, which means that you can orchestrate tasks that run on independent distributed workers, instead of all your code running locally on one single machine aka your laptop. But in order to fully take advantage of this programming model, you need to learn how to think in terms of distributed tasks, rather than a single script that runs from start to finish in a single process on a single local machine. 

So based on your description, I would suggest you either don't use Airflow because you don't truly need a distributed job orchestrator, OR that you learn how to redesign your existing script to be broken down into separate individual self contained tasks. 

For an example of what I mean: 

* When running locally on your laptop, your data script might do something like this, where all the steps happen in a single process execution -- start by calling external API or reading from external source and downloading raw data; optionally write that data to local disk for persistence, before loading into a Pandas data frame; do some in-memory manipulations of your data frame, to transform the data in whatever way you need; when you're satisfied with the data, write it out to disk or call an external API to push the data there. If your script fails, you'd probably rerun the whole script from the beginning, because maybe you didn't create any ""resume"" capability for the script to restart from a halfway point. 
* In a distributed compute world, not only would downloading data, transforming data, and publishing data be different tasks in the overall DAG, but you also need to think carefully about how the tasks actually coordinate the flow of data, since you no longer share local compute (i.e. you don't share memory, you don't share disk, because the tasks actually run on different computers). So your tasks may need to read/write to a cloud storage service or an external database or data warehouse, and your tasks will need to be more explicit and decoupled from each other, compared to a single script where you are just chaining function calls together within the same shared process or shared memory and disk -- as a silly/trivial illustration of what I mean: you can't just reference the same variables across different tasks, not like the way you can when everything exists in a single script on a single machine.",10,1737240075.0

For data engineering specifically, your analysis background will help you build better data models and pipelines because you understand how the data will be used.

For analytics and data science, tools like Python with pandas, R, or modern BI platforms like Looker or Power BI are essential.

1i3dvqc,m7m0ch9,"Power BI consultant here. I've done SQL Server health checks before and I'm working on a learning Fabric, a competitor to Databricks.

If I were you, I would treat yourself as 75% home inspector and 25% architect. Your primary goal is to find all the leaky plumbing, fire hazards, and black mold. If you do your job well, the customer will come back to your company and ask them to apply fixes, so that's where the architect part comes in. You need some sense of the ideal architecture and how they should fix things.

You have to ask yourself, who is the economic buyer here. Who approved this project and who is ***paying*** for it? They are your target audience, but your deliverables may be handed off to be fixed in-house. So you have two audiences: the metaphorical home owner and the metaphorical handyman (or woman).

You mentioned Databricks. This means there is a high chance they are using the [Medallion Architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture), Spark, Delta Lake, and Lakehouses. I would start here. How organized is their data lake? Are they making good use of delta lake or are they suffering from the [small file problem](https://delta.io/blog/2023-01-25-delta-lake-small-file-compaction-optimize/)? Do they have a structure and a system for their data pipelines?

Typically, I structured health checks in terms of issues sorted by 1) risk to the business and 2) difficulty to mitigate/repair. This allowed the business to target both critical deficits as well as quick fixes. You project is broader and will need more of an overall grade, so to speak.

Hope that helps!",15,1737112610.0

1i3dvqc,m7msb8n,"Thanks for the detailed response. It's really helpful and gives me a good starting point! I have a few questions specifically about the assessment process itself:

1. Is there a standard or ideal template for structuring the assessment documentation? 

  
2. What’s the best way to approach the actual assessment? Do you typically start with interviews, reviewing documentation, or diving into their data pipelines and architecture directly? Is there a recommended step-by-step process?

  
3. Are there any common mistakes or oversights I should avoid while conducting or documenting the assessment?",3,1737124287.0
1i3dvqc,m7mwow1,"I'm not aware of anything standard, no. At that level, every customer is a unique snowflake. I would probably start by working with a technical resource to put together an architecture diagram as well as identifying all the downstream stakeholders of that architecture (Data scientists, data engineers, BI devs, data analysts, business users).

You should be able to answer why each piece of the architecture exists, what it's intended purpose is and how well it is solving that. You should be able to articulate the tradeoffs in data size, data latency/freshness, data quality, and cost. They are using Databricks for example. 

Why not a relational database like Postgres or SQL Server? Is it data volumes? Is it automation with Spark notebooks? Is it what the existing data team was most experience with?

Everything exists for a reason and you should be able to answer why before you [recommend tearing it down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence). Once you have a high level of what and ***why***, you can dig into the how.

If I was doing this, I'd start with documentation and a whiteboarding session with someone who can map out the architecture. Then I'd iterate from there. I would produce an architecture diagram, maybe some more detailed zoomed in portions (Databricks as one node -> What is on databricks?), a word doc describing the architecture and current tradeoffs, and another doc proposing changes or improvements.",6,1737125713.0

1i3sr2y,m7px97t,Might’ve answered some of my own question. I think I’ll go a hybrid route. I’ll setup mongodb and some of the more common fields maybe setup a RDBMS.

1i3h048,m7pvmhe,"I have some strong opinions about them, the overarching theme being they are a beta feature that made its way to production. 

Cons: 
- You can’t target multiple catalog.schemas and the private preview to do so has been going on forever. 
- You can’t have libraries installed in development mode and keep the cluster up. 
- You cannot view the event log table unless you’re the pipeline creator(which should be a SP)
- The declarative nature causes issues with some necessary spark operations (.collect)
- With new DBR runtimes you’re fully expected to use the ‘validate’ option, not apc compute with the DLT package. This is a horrible decision imo. 
- Deleting pipelines removes the tables (this is changing 1/30). 
- Fully refreshing tables will cause version mismatch with downstream tables. (very challenging if you have dependent pipelines). 
- Limits with streaming vs MV tables and where they fall in a pipeline. 
- Some common data warehousing steps cannot happen in DLT (type 3 dims).

Pros: 
- The declarative nature can be nice. 
- Autoloader checkpoints are managed and automated for you. 
- Table optimization is built in. 
- isolated compute can be nice sometimes. 
- The dag is sexy.

1i3h048,m7pfwv9,"I think you're spot on with the proprietary nature of it being an issue. I've always felt writing my own pipelines and ETL templates is more cost effective.

I also like that my code can all be in one workflow vs. the dlt GUI for git integration and just ease of use.

To me it’s about control and flexibility. If I want to be in control of every configuration and operator in my pipelines then I don’t use DLT, this is especially important for streaming. If I have simpler pipelines and want to enforce data quality expectations etc then use DLT.

My post was written by me, this is just meant to provide more context. 

I wanted to add a bit more depth to the concepts I’ve outlined and clarify the practical vision for ActiveData.

How ActiveData Works in Practice

At its core, ActiveData is about simplifying complexity. The ecosystem layers on top of existing systems, meaning you don’t have to rip and replace—it uses the data you already have, structured in a way that provides actionable insights in real time.

	1.	ActiveGraphs:

Think of this as a relational map that encodes context and relationships in your data. It’s like taking a flat table of patient records and mapping it into a dynamic graph where nodes represent patients, treatments, and doctors, and edges represent relationships like appointment history or diagnosis results.

Example: 

Mapping relationships in a hospital, you could uncover insights like:

	•	Which treatments have the best outcomes for certain demographics.

	•	How doctor-patient interactions affect long-term health.

	2.	ActiveQube (formerly Cube4D):

Imagine storing your data in a 4D hypercube (like a tesseract). This adds context, such as time or location, directly into the data structure, making multi-dimensional queries simple and intuitive.

Example: 

For a retail business, you could query:

	•	How does sales performance change by location, time of day, and product category?

	3.	ActiveShell:
The interface is designed to feel familiar, using a syntax inspired by PowerShell but with an added dimension of truth—allowing you to query with precision and context.
Example Syntax:

Get-node-Transaction | Where {Amount > 10000 and Location -eq ‘New York’}
Add-node-Patient -name.first John -name.last Doe -condition “Iron Deficiency”

The goal here is to let you interact with your data naturally, making complex queries feel intuitive.

Why This Matters

The current challenge in data engineering isn’t just collecting data—it’s unlocking its potential. Most organizations already have the data they need but lack the tools to connect the dots, uncover relationships, and act on insights. ActiveData bridges this gap, enabling real-time decision-making.

Looking for Collaborators

I’m hoping to connect with data engineers, architects, or anyone curious about building out a Proof of Concept. Whether you’re interested in cloud architecture, AI/ML integration, or designing a seamless UI/UX, there’s a place for your skills in this vision.

Let me know if this resonates, or feel free to share your thoughts! I’m also happy to answer any questions or dive deeper into specific components of the ecosystem.

EDIT- Also make sure you add `CASCADE` to the command to update the schema for the older partitions, if needed.
