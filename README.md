# Reddit_Project

Senior Project Proposal
Personal Background
I am a Data Science major at BYU-Idaho, focusing on data engineer. I have completed MATH 425 (Statistical Modeling), CS 450 (Machine Learning), and Data 460(Big Data). After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in data engineering, specializing in big data technologies like PySpark and SQL. My BYU-Idaho email is lee20030@byui.edu.________________________________________Project Background
In the AI era, high-quality, domain-specific data like Reddit discussions are crucial for sentiment analysis, trend detection, and topic modeling. Companies increasingly purchase such data for AI training and decision-making. This project focuses on analyzing social media trends and user sentiments from Reddit to understand public opinion over time and identify key topics, benefiting industries like marketing and policy-making.________________________________________Domain to Investigate
For this project, I will study the following key domains:
•	Studying data extraction from Reddit's API using Python and tools like PRAW or Web scraping to efficiently collect high-quality social media data.
•	Working on implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and trend detection to analyze text data using pyspark.
•	Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations using to present findings effectively
________________________________________Proposed Deliverables
1.	Develop an ETL pipeline to extract, clean, and store social media data using APIs.
2.	Preprocess and clean text data, including tokenization, and stopword removal
3.	Perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling to identify key trends and user emotions.
4.	Build an interactive visualization dashboard (using Plotly or Dash) to present trends and analysis results.
