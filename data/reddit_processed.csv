Im primarily DS with quite a number of years in DS and DE Ive mostly worked with onsite infrastructure 

My stack is currently Python Julia R and my field of interest is numerical computing OpenMP MPI and GPU parallel computing down the line

Im curious as to how best to align my current work with high level languages with my interest in lower level languages 

If I were deciding based on work alone Fortran will be the best language for me to learn as theres a lot of legacy code wed have to port in the next years 

However Id like to develop in a language thatll complement the skill set of a DS

My current view is Julia C and Fortran However Im not completely sure of how useful these are outside of my veryspecific field 

Are there any other DS that have gone through this How did you decide What would you recommend What factors did you consider",5,11,2025-01-22 12:41:54,datascience,38,870

When I was interviewed I explained that I had no experience with pivot tables or vlookup It was my understanding from the interview that they were looking for someone to mentor and I was hired on for having a great attitude During onboarding I was given pretty surface level material to review and met maybe a handful of times with others on the teams on building basic reports Ive had to do a lot of studying on my own time During the year though I have continued to struggle on the reporting aspect of my job and feel the relationship strains at work because of it I am proud to say that I have been practicing excel files online with sample data at home for months and can successfully create files on my own Ive asked to shadow and practice files at home but I was told to just learn more about the company and ask more questions This is the kind of scenario I keep running into at my current job

Ex A few weeks ago I was tasked to create a report I was told to look at a few automated reports and essentially play aroundfigure it out I was trained on two automated reports but had not been trained on the others My team was a bit annoyed with my confusion on which report I should use and that I should know based on the data They gave me a suggestion on what report to try I played around with the data on my own and got like 70 with the data I had I was told yesterday that they decided to pull data elsewhere because it would cover everything they wanted on the report more easily  from a space I dont have access to and havent been trained on",43,38,2025-01-21 19:04:34,datascience,88,1920

1i5576y,Should I Try to postpone my FAANG Interview,"So I got contacted by a FAANG Recruiter for a Data Scientist Role I applied for a month and a half ago But as I have started to prep I realize I am not ready and need 1 to 2 months before I would be able to do well on all the technical interviews there are 4 of them My SQL is rusty because I have been using Pyspark so much that I didnt really need to do medium to hard SQL queries at work Were also not allowed in most cases since SQL is slower So I would just do everything in Pyspark But now as I start practicing my SQL I realize its very basic and its going to take some time before I can get it on the level my pyspark is at

Ive noticed that I feel like there is no chance of me performing well enough on this interview and it sucks because the recruiter said that the hiring manager was looking at my resume and really wants to interview me as soon as possible since he thinks I have strong experience for the role They made me bypass the phone screens because of it I have no doubt I would be able to do the role but interviews are another beast According to the prep guide my Stats ML Theory SQL and Python all have to be perfect Since I joined my current company as an intern I didnt have to do as many indepth technicals as I have to do here Ive interviewed at a couple other big companies last year and didnt make it to the final round for one simply because I needed more time to prepare The FAANG recruiter wants me to do the first 2 interviews within the next two weeks and Im worried about what it would do to my confidence if I failed this interview since this is pretty much my dream Data Scientist role My mind is already telling me just to make the best of this and use it as a learning experience but another part of me is wondering if I should just cancel it altogether or try to delay it as much as possible I have a mock interview with a Company Data Scientist they set up for me in a few days but part of me feels defeated already and it sucks

1i2vmuv,Introducing mlsynth,"Hi DS Reddit For those of who you work in causal inference you may be interested in a Python library I developed called machine learning synthetic control or mlsynth for short

As I write in its documentation mlsynth is a onestop shop of sorts for implementing some of the most recent synthetic control based estimators many of which use machine learning methodologies Currently the software is hosted from my GitHub and it is still undergoing developments ie for computing inference for pointestinatesuser friendliness

mlsynth implements the following methods Augmented DifferenceinDifferences CLUSTERSCM Debiased Convex Regression  undocumented at present the Factor Model Approach Forward DifferenceinDifferences Forward Selected Panel Data Approach the L1PDA the L2relaxation PDA Principal Component Regression Robust PCA Synthetic Control Synthetic Control Method Vanilla SCM Two Step Synthetic Control  and finally the two newest methods which are not yet fully documented Proximal InferenceSCM and Proximal Inference with SurrogatesSCM  

While each method has their own options eg Bayesian or not l2 relaxer versus L1 all methods have a common syntax which allows us to switch seamlessly between methods without needing to switch softwares or learn a new syntax for a different librarycommand It also brings forth methods which either had no public documentation yet or were written mostly forin MATLAB

The documentation that currently exists explains installation as well as the basic methodology of each method I also provide worked examples from the academic literature to serve as a reference point for how one may use the code to estimate causal effects

So to anybody who uses Python and causal methods on a regular basis this is an option that may suit your needs better than standard techniques",22,7,2025-01-16 18:27:30,datascience,19,1812

I like the attitude but I tried myself a few years ago and got burned So I wanna share my experience 
   
I am a Data Scientist and tried to start freelancing with just one year job experience in 2017 Did the usual stuff Set up an Upwork profile applied to jobs at nights and during weekends and waited for a reply 
Crickets I applied to 11 jobs and didnt get any Looking back at that experience I see a few mistakes
1 I didnt have a portfolio of projects that matched the jobs I applied to 
2 I only used Upwork without leveraging LInkedIn Catalant Fiverr and others 
3 I gave up too early Just 11 applications over one month is not enough I recommend applying to 2030 jobs per week if possible
4 I set an unreasonable hourly rate I set my hourly rate same as my daily job Freelancing is a market where you are the product When there is no demand for you because nobody knows you its a smart move to set the price low Once demand picks up increase the price accordingly 

Overall I think experience is not the number one factor that a client looks for when hiring a freelancer Its way more important to give the client confidence that you can do the job So you should always work with that goal in mind from the way you build your profile to all the communication with your client 
Last bit of advice I found success in my local market at first In Italy there is not many Data professionals that are also freelancers and that helped me People like to work with familiar faces and speaking the same language sharing the same culture goes a long way building confidence

this would also help the other teams that depend on our output web development can use a model it is just a bad model but well improve the results the deployment work could also start now

Just a thought but Ive always thought of some sort of consultancy where clients are some sort of local business that collects data but doesnt use it effectively or does not have the expertise on how to turn their data into insights that can be used 

For example suppose you had three clients

1 Local gyms which have lots of membership data  my consultancy could offer services to measure engagement etc and use demographic information to further understand gym goers  dont know what action they could take but a thought 

2 Local shop has expenses they track and right now its all over the place A dashboard that can help them view everything in one place

Something where its tasks which are trivial for the average data scientist but generate a lot of value for local businesses

1i275yh,WASMpowered codespaces for Python notebooks on GitHub,"During a hackweek we built this project that allows you to run marimo and Jupyter notebooks directly from GitHub in a Wasmpowered codespacelike environment What makes this powerful is that we mount the GitHub repositorys contents as a filesystem in the notebook making it really easy to share notebooks with data

All you need to do is prepend  to any Python notebook on GitHub Some examples

 Jupyter Notebook 
 marimo notebook 

Jupyter notebooks are automatically converted into marimo notebooks using basic static analysis and source code transformations Our conversion logic assumes the notebook was meant to be run topdown which is usually but not always true 2 It can convert many notebooks but there are still some edge cases

We implemented the filesystem mount using our own FUSElike adapter that links the GitHub repositorys contents to the Python filesystem leveraging Emscriptens filesystem API The file tree is loaded on startup to avoid waterfall requests when reading many directories deep but loading the file contents is lazy For example when you write Python that looks like

    with opendatacarscsv as f
        printfread
    
     or
    
    import pandas as pd

Why is this useful

Vieiwng notebooks on GitHub pages is limiting They dont allow external css or scripts so charts and advanced widgets can fail They also arent itneractive so you cant tweek a value or panzoom a chart It is also difficult to share your notebook with code  you either need to host it somehwere or embed it inside your notebook Just append",11,0,2025-01-15 20:38:41,datascience,53,1716
1i29a6d,Advanced Imputation Techniques for Correlated Time Series Insights and Experiences,"Advanced Imputation Techniques for Correlated Time Series Insights and Experiences

Hi everyone

Im looking to spark a discussion about advanced imputation techniques for datasets with multiple distinct but correlated time series Imagine a dataset like energy consumption or sales data where hundreds of stores or buildings are measured separately The granularity might be hourly or daily with varying levels of data completeness across the time series

Heres the challenge

1 Some buildingsstores have complete or nearly complete data with only a few missing values These are straightforward to impute using standard techniques
2 Others have partial data with gaps ranging from days to months
3 Finally there are buildings with 100 missing values for the target variable across the entire time frame leaving us reliant on correlated data and features

The time series show clear seasonal patterns weekly annual and dependencies on external factors like weather customer counts or building size While these features are available for all buildingsincluding those with no target datathe features alone are insufficient to accurately predict the target Correlations between the time series range from moderate 03 to very high 09 making the data situation highly heterogeneous

 My Current Approach

For storesbuildings with few or no data points Im considering an approach that involves

1 Using Correlated Stores Identify stores with high correlations based on available data eg monthly aggregates These could serve as a foundation for imputing the missing time series
2 Reconciling to Monthly Totals If we know the monthly sums of the target for stores with missing hourlydaily data we could constrain the imputed time series to match these totals For example adjust the imputed hourlydaily values so that their sum equals the known monthly figure
3 Incorporating Known Features For stores with missing target data use additional features eg holidays temperature building size or operational hours to refine the imputed time series For example if a store was closed on a Monday due to repairs or a holiday the imputation should respect this and redistribute values accordingly

 Why Just Using Correlated Stores Isnt Enough

While using highly correlated stores for imputation seems like a natural approach it has limitations For instance

 A store might be closed on certain days eg repairs or holidays resulting in zero or drastically reduced energy consumption Simply copying or scaling values from correlated stores wont account for this
 The known features for the missing store eg building size operational hours or customer counts might differ significantly from those of the correlated stores leading to biased imputations
 Seasonal patterns eg weekends vs weekdays may vary slightly between stores due to operational differences

 Open Questions

 Feature Integration How can we better incorporate the available features of stores with 100 missing values into the imputation process while respecting known totals eg monthly sums
 Handling CorrelationBased Imputation Are there specific techniques or algorithms that work well for leveraging correlations between time series for imputation
 Practical Adjustments When reconciling imputed values to match known totals what methods work best for redistributing values while preserving the overall seasonal and temporal patterns

From my perspective this approach seems sensible but Im curious about others experiences with similar problems or opinions on why this mightor might notwork in practice If youve dealt with imputation in datasets with heterogeneous time series and varying levels of completeness Id love to hear your insights

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and ideas",9,3,2025-01-15 22:10:31,datascience,82,3739

1i1bjhi,Evalues A modern alternative to pvalues,"In many modern applications  AB testing clinical trials quality monitoring  we need to analyze data as it arrives Traditional statistical tools werent designed with this sequential analysis in mind which has led to the development of new approaches

Evalues are one such tool specifically designed for sequential testing They provide a natural way to measure evidence that accumulates over time An evalue of 20 represents 20to1 evidence against your null hypothesis  a direct and intuitive interpretation Theyre particularly useful when you need to

 Monitor results in realtime
 Add more samples to ongoing experiments
 Combine evidence from multiple analyses
 Make decisions based on continuous data streams

While pvalues remain valuable for fixedsample scenarios evalues offer complementary strengths for sequential analysis Theyre increasingly used in tech companies for AB testing and in clinical trials for interim analyses

If you work with sequential data or continuous monitoring evalues might be a useful addition to your statistical toolkit Happy to discuss specific applications or mathematical details in the comments

And let me tell you I have never seen a stinking hot pile of mess than pandas Everything is 10 layers of stupid The syntax makes me scream There is no coherence or pattern  Oh use  here but no use  here
Want to do a if else ooops better download numpy 
Want to filter ooops use loc and then iloc and write 10 lines of code

At the moment Im making over 100k working remotely from eastern Europe for a FAANG in the US they have an office here but my entire data science team is based in the US and Im working on the same things as them

When applying to companies in the USUK Im receiving zero callbacks willing to relocate although companies from the same areas are reaching out with remote offers of 100kyear Those dont have the benefits of my current company and are not attractive opportunities Im looking to relocate and get 200k Current internal transfers to the US are closed as they are looking to expand in east Europe Ive also asked for more difficult projects but those are only available for US not for my region

The projects that are open to me at the moment offer zero satisfaction and I want to solve more complex problems and continue to expand my skills but Im stuck for the only thing that my studies are in eastern Europe and that I dont hold a PhD even though Ive already worked on novel models in industry and speaking with friends and colleagues that hold a PhD my skills are on par

Im at a point where I feel like skills and projects dont mean absolutely anything and the only thing that has any weight for getting a job are diplomas and people you know Maybe Im exaggerating but from all of my experiences Im starting to feel like people from my region without studies abroad are seen only as cheap labor that should never be given the chance to work on real problems and be paid accordingly a shitty company directly told me that while another told me explicitly that my skills dont matter and theyre only offering bad projects with bad pay in my region Its like theres a limit to the level of difficulty I can work on and the pay I can receive regardless of how much I outcompete others

At the moment Im working on a side research project that Ill be sending to some top tier conferences and then try getting a PhD in the west but that will take years and if I already have the skills its so frustrating to be stuck for so long just for a diploma and a title

Now what pisses me off is that now I need to come up with a way to get an accuracy per class in a multilabel classification setting based solely on precision and recall per class because different models were evaluated by different people at different times and I really only have those 2 metrics per class  precision and recall I dont even know if this is possible it feels like it isnt and is an overall dumb metric for our use case All because investors only know the word accuracy

Would it not be enough to say This is the F1 score for our most important classes and as you can see none of the other models or architectures weve tried are as good as our best model By the way if you dont know what F1 means just know that higher scores are better If you want I can explain it in more detail as opposed to getting metrics that do not make any sense

I underwent a technical interview for a DS role at a company The company was nice enough to provide feedback This reason was not only reason I was rejected but I wanted to share because it was very surprising to me 

They said I aced the programming However hey gave me feedback that my statistics performance was mixed I was surprised The question was what type of model would I use for an AB test with time spent on an app as an outcome I suspect many would use a ttest but I believe that would be inappropriate since time is a skewed outcome with only positive values so a ttest would not fit the data well ie Gaussian outcome I suggested a lognormal or loggamma generalized linear model instead

  
I later received feedback that I was penalized for suggesting a linear model for the AB test However a linear model with a binary predictor is equivalent to a ttest I dont want to be arrogant or presumptuous that I think the interviewer is wrong and I am right but I am struggling to have any other interpretation than the interviewer did not realize a linear model with a binary predictor is equivalent to a ttest

 Desired outcome is to understand the impact of removing the outdated new user onboarding flow in our app

 Control group users in the previous app version who did experience the new user flow
 Treatment group users in the new app version who would have gotten the new user flow had it not been removed

The last company I was at the data scientist did not use DBT or any sort of feature store We just hit the raw data and write sql for our project

The argument for our extensive feature store seems to be that it allows for reusability of complex logic across projects And yes this is occasionally true But it is just as often true that there is a Table that is used for exactly one project 

Now that Im starting to get comfortable with the company Im starting to see the crack in all of this complex tables built on top of complex tables built in to of complex tables built on raw data Leakage and ambiguity everywhere Onboarding is a beast 

I understand there are times when it might be computationally important to precompute some calculation when doing realtime inference But this is in most cases the exception not the rule Most models can be run on a schedule

1huoyaf,What schema or data model are you using for your LLM  RAG prototyping,"How are you organizing your data for your RAG applications Ive searched all over and have found tons of tutorials about how the tech stack works but very little about how the data is actually stored I dont want to just create an application that can give an answer I want something I can use to evaluate my progress as I improve my prompts and retrievals

This is the kind of stuff that I think needs to be stored

 Prompt templates ie versioning my prompts
 Final inputs to and outputs from the LLM provider and associated metadata
 Chunks of all my documents to be used in RAG
 The chunks that were retrieved for a given prompt so that I can evaluate the performance of the retrieval step
 Conversations or chains for when there might be multiple requests sent to an LLM for a given question
 Experiments This is for the purposes of evaluation It would associate an experiment ID with a series of inputsoutputs for an evaluation set of questions

I cant be the first person to hit this issue I started off with a simple SQLite database with a handful of tables and now that Im going to be incorporating RAG into the application and probably agentic stuff soon I really want to leverage someone elses learning so I dont rediscover all the same mistakes",9,5,2025-01-06 02:52:15,datascience,69,1253

1htlb8y,I dont like my current subfield of DS,"I have been in Data Science for 5 years and working as Senior Data Scientist for a big company

In my DS journey most of my work are Applied Data Science where I was working on creating and training models improving models and analysing features and make improvements so on I worked on both ML DL models which I loved 

Recently I have been moved to marketing data science where it feels like it is not appealing to me as Im doing Product Data science with designing Experiment analysing causal impact Media mix modeling so on also Im somewhat not well experienced in Bayesian models or causal inference still learning 

But in this field what I feel is you do buch of stuff to answer to business stakeholder in 1 or 2 slides and move on to next business question  Also even if you come up with something business always work based on traditional way with their past experience Im not feeling motivated and not seeing any of my solution is creating an impact

Firstly why do you think this is occurring Ive seen a lot of people mention the H1B visa is a key issue surrounding this though I personally havent a clue

Secondly is there a vast difference in the UK and USA job markets surrounding data science roles and is the market just as bad in the UK as it is in the USA

Thirdly are these CS graduates who are unable to get tech jobs migrating to more DScentred jobs This will obviously saturate the DS job market significantly

Im currently a data manager in a school but my job is mostly just MIS upkeep data returns and using very basic built in analytics tools to view data

I have looked online and apparently there are jobs as data scientists within schools but there are so many prebuilt analytics tools and government performance measures for things like student progress that I am not sure there is any value in trying to build a tool that predicts student performance etc 

Does anyone work as a data scientist in a school chain of schools If so what does your job usually entail Does anyone have any suggestions on the type of project I can undertake I have access to student performance data and maybe financial data across 4 secondary schools and maybe 23 primary schools

I am curious to learn how folks view themselves and the various titles in this field Assuming Data Science is the umbrella that encompasses computer science machine learning statistics maths etc and there is a spectrum of roles within this field how would you selfidentify The rules are

1 It doesnt have to be your actual title from your employer or degree major
2 It doesnt have to be a formally known identity For example you can identify as a number cruncher a tableau manager a deep learning developer make up your own or just use a formal identity such as Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer
3 You have to also add your justification ie why do you believe such identity justly represents youyour role
4 It should be selfexplainable technical maturely and reasonably justified So avoid the likes of Ninja Unicorn Guru unless you can maturely make a compelling argument
5 You must be open to criticism and being challenged Other redditors are not compelled to agree with your selfidentity

1hp7pim,My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist,"Background

Im a selftaught data scientist with about 5 years of data analyst experience and now about 5 years as a Data Scientist Im more math minded than the average person but Im not special I have a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering and have worked alongside 6 data scientists 4 of which have PHDs and the other 2 have a masters Despite being probably the 6th out of 7 in natural ability I have been the 2nd most productive data scientist out of the group


Gatekeeping

Every day someone on this subreddit asks some derivative of what do I need to know to get started in MLDS The answers are always smug and give some insane list of courses and topics one must master As someone whos been on both sides this is attitude extremely annoying and rampart in the industry I dont think you can be bad at math and have no prerequisite knowledge and be successful but the levels needed are greatly exaggerated Most of the people telling you these things are just posturing due to insecurity



As a mechanical engineering student I had at least 3 calculus courses a linear algebra course and a probability course but it was 10 years before I attempted to become a DS and I didnt remember much at all This sub and others like it made me think I had to be an expert in all these topics and many more to even think about trying to become a data scientist 



When I started my journey I would take coding calculus stats linear algebra etc courses Id take a course do OK in it and move onto the next thing However eventually Id get defeated because I realized I couldnt remember much from the courses I took 3 months prior It just felt like too much information for me to hold at a single time while working a fulltime job I never got started on actually solving problems because the internet and industry told me I needed to be an expert in all these things


What you actually need

The reality is 95 of the time you only need a basic understanding of these topics Projects often require a deeper dive into something else but thats a case by case basis and you figure that out as you go


For calculus you dont need to know how to integrate multivariable functions by hand You need to know that derivatives create a function that represents the slope of the original function and that where the derivative  0 is a local minmax You need to know integrals are area under the curve



For stats you need to understand what a p value represents You dont need to know all the different tests and when to use them You need to know that they exist and why you need them When its time to use one just google it and figure out which one best suits your use case



For linear algebra you dont need to know how to solve for eigenvectors by hand or whatever other specific things you do in that class You need to know how to read it It is also helpful to know properties of linear algebra Like the cross product of 2 vectors yields a vector perpendicular to both



For probability you need to understand basic things but again just google your specific problem



You dont need to be an expert software dev You need to write ok code and be able to use chatGPT to help you improve it little by little



You dont need to know how to build all the algorithms by hand A general understanding of how they work is enough in 95 of cases



Of all of those things the only thing you absolutely NEED to get started is basic coding ability 



By far the number one technical ability needed to master is understanding how to frame your problem and how to test and evaluate and interpret performance If you can ensure that youre accurately framing the problem and evaluating the model or alogithm with metrics that correctly align with the use case thats enough to start providing some real value I often see people asking things like should I do this feature engineering technique for this problem or which of these algorithms will perform best The answer should usually be I dont know try it measure it and see Understanding how the algorithms work can give you clues into what you should try but at the end of the day you should just try it and see   



Despite the posturing in the industry very few people are actually experts in all these domains Some people are better at talking the talk than others but at the end of the day you WILL have to constantly research and learn on a project by project basis Thats what makes it fun and interesting As you gain PRACTICAL experience you will grow you will learn you will improve beyond what you couldve ever imagined Just get the basics down and get started dont spin your wheels trying and failing to nail all these disciplines before ever applying anything



The reason Im near the top in productivity while being near the bottom in natural and technical ability is my 5 years of experience as a data analyst at my company During this time I got really good at exploring my companies data When you are stumped on problem intelligently visualizing the data often reveals the solution Ive also had the luxury of analyzing our data from all different perspectives Id have assignments from marketing product tech support customer service software firmware and other technical teams I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists Im also just aware of more tips and tricks than anyone else  



Good domain knowledge and data exploration skills with average technical skills will outperform good technical skills with average domain knowledge and data exploration almost every time 


Advice for those self taught


Ive been on the hiring side of things a few times now and the market is certainly difficult I think it would be very difficult for someone to online course and side project themselves directly into a DS job The side project would have to be EXTREMELY impressive to be considered However I think my path is repeatable



I taught myself basic SQL and Tableau and completed a few side projects I accepted a job as a data analyst in a medium sized 100200 total employees on a team where DS and DA shared the same boss The barrier to DA is likely higher than it was 10 years ago but its definitely something achievable My advice would be to find roles that you have some sort of unique experience with and tailor your resume to that connection No connection is too small For example my DA role required working with a lot of accelerometer data In my previous job as a test engineer I sometimes helped set up accelerometers to record data from the tests This experience barely helped me at all when actually on the job but it helped my resume actually get looked at For entry level jobs employers are looking for ANY connection because most entry level resumes all look the same


The first year or two I excelled at my role as a DA I made my boss aware that I wanted to become a DS eventually He started to make me a small part of some DS projects running queries building dashboards to track performance and things like that I was also a part of some of the meetings so I got some insight into how certain problems were approached 



My boss made me aware that I would need to teach myself to code and machine learning My role in the data science projects grew over time but I was ultimately blocked from becoming a DS because I kept trying and failing to learn to code and the 25 areas of expertise reddit tells you that you need by taking MOOCs 

  

Eventually I paid up for DataQuest I naively thought the course would teach me everything I needed to know While you will not be proficient in anything DS upon completing the interactive format made it easy to jump into 3060 minutes of structured coding every day Like a real language consistency is vital 



Once I got to the point where I could do some basic coding I began my own side project THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ONCE YOU GET THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE JUST GET STARTED WORKING ON THINGS This is where the real learning began Youll screw things up and thats ok Titanic problem is fine for day 1 but you really need a project of your own I picked a project that I was interested in and had a function that I would personally use Im on V3 of this project and its grown to a level that I never couldve dreamed of at the time This was crucial in ensuring that I stuck with the project and had real investment in doing it correctly When I didnt know how to do something in the project I would research it and figure it out This is how it works in the real world



After 3 months of Dataquest and another 3 of a project along with 4 years of being a data analyst I convinced my boss to assign me DS project I worked alongside another data scientist but I owned the project and they were mostly there for guidance and coded some of the more complex things I excelled at that project and was promoted to data scientist and began getting projects of my own with less and less oversight We have a very collaborative work environment and the data scientists are truly out to help each other We present our progress to each other often which allows us all to learn and improve I have been promoted twice since I began DS work



Id like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in less time than it took me I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed Dont blindly use it but its a great resource


Tldr Sir this is Wendys

Edit Im not saying to never go deeper into things Im literally always learning I go deeper into things all the time Often in very niche domains but you dont need to be a master in all things get started or even excel Be able to understand generalities of those domains and dig deeper when the problem calls for it Learning a concept when you have a direct application is much more likely to stick


I thought it went without saying but Im not saying those things I listed are literally the only things you need to know about those topics I was just giving examples of where relatively simple concepts were way more important than specifics

Edit 2 Im not saying schooling is bad Yes obviously having a masters andor PhD is better than not Im directing this to those who are working a full time job who want to break into the field but taking years getting a masters while working full time and going another 50K into debt is unrealistic",1977,168,2024-12-29 22:28:05,datascience,59,10371

1hpaa3c,Looking for some Senior DS Advice,"Hello everyone

I think this is okay to be a post since its not about enteringtransitioning but if I need to repost in the weekly threads please let me know 

TLDR

 I started working as a Data Scientist at a medium to large company almost 3 years ago
 I spent the majority of my time doing more Software EngineeringData Engineering related tasks with DS projects sprinkled in
 A reorg changed the entire landscape of my company and potential growth at the company
 I dont know what to do because I dont know if I got solid enough experience to leave for another DS job but my current situation is very uncomfortable
 Looking for any seasoned perspectiveadvice on the situation to help anchor me since Im in a bit of a doom spiral 



I am looking for some career advice I dont want to write a novel about my journey to this point but it was a hell of a lot of work A snippet of my relevant work experience is I worked at various tech startups doing Data AnalystEngineering work before I found my way to DS I graduated with my MS in Data Science back in 2021 and I landed a job at a mediumlarge global business in the retail space To my surprise it was the common meme situation where they had no infrastructure put in place for DS work and on top of that a former IBM DS had built a Python application being used by an internal team that was barely hanging on

Year 1 

My boss asked if Id be able to modernize the application and since I have a bit of a programming background I told them Id be happy to do that to get my feet wet with the org I am going to way oversimplify the work I did for the sake of time The important part is this project took around 6 months as the org had everything onprem so I had to go through approvals to get the more modern tech I refactored a large portion of it containerized it and deployed it via an OpenShift RedHats Kubernetes product cluster The bulk of the program was a massive Jupyter Notebook 5000 lines of code with some custombuilt math libraries that an analyst would execute each cell after a request was made This notebook housed all the business logic so I just wrapped all that up to be executed automatically when the internal team interacted with the new app By the end of it I had a firm grasp on various business processes and was already talking to my boss about possibilities Additionally I found out that I was the only Data Scientist on staff and I was a little bummed because I had chosen to work for a larger org in hopes of getting some sort of mentorlearnbyosmosis going on However since my background is in startups I wasnt overly concerned because I knew I could utilize this environment to grow by trailblazing

The conversation then shifted to the logic in the notebook and the fact that no one really knew what was happening inside it This notebook was driving a fairly important piece of the business by analyzing various datapoints applying business rules and spitting out results to be used day to day They asked if I could dissect it and I readily agreed  really wish LLMs were as commercialized as they are now I spent the next 23 months working out bugs in the newly deployed app and flow charting out all the business logic inside the notebook into nice Confluence pages It was fairly spaghettified so making changes to it was going to prove challenging I put my Product Manager hat on and asked what their goals were with this application the logic measuring success etc I was asked to start a rewrite so that the laundry list of changes they had wanted to make could be done It was also at this time my boss was super happy with the ideaswork I had done I had several other smaller projects I did during this time so they began speaking to me about being promoted up How wed get an actual software engineer on my team so I could focus on more of the Data Science stuff I was super excitedanxious because I was hoping to get more handson DS experience before leading a team However once again I come from startups so sort of par for the course



Year 2 

The IT department announces a reorg a month before my promotion By this point I had job descriptions for a few new positions and we had made plans for who would be shifting to my team All of this gets put on hold and theres tons of uncertainty I spend the next year doing the rewrite by myself I build a few classification models in the process to help a few other internal teams operate more efficiently

Basically they come through with a domaindriven design philosophy so that the Software teams can build more efficiently by having more autonomy They establish practices across the domains and they had a DataML practice initially That gave me some confidence that Id at least have peers when it was all said and done



Year 3  Current year 

I get moved into a domain and they establish a separate BI  Analytics domain They decentralized everything else but anything to do with Data Work I am given a promotion to DS Manager with a single employee  a Data Engineer It has been super confusing all year with things taking much longer as the org adjusts for the new bureaucratic processes that have been introduced  tooling now has to be approved Business analyst delivery leads PMO offices etc I meet with the head of engineering to ask how I go about getting tools approved Sage Maker endpoints and to get a sense of our overall data strategy Im basically told there isnt one in place but they hope to get one together soonish A lot has happened and it all feels very confusing Basically no one is empowered to make decisions the BI domain is leading the charge for their stuff and me and my team are sort of this island that exists outside of everything else going on



I tried to keep that as short as possible and happy to give further detail if you believe itd help



Heres my main issue I spent these years doing what needed to be done but there really isnt a path of growth because they arent really accounting for Data Scientists yet  though they say they hope to hire them It was clear in the first year what the path would probably look like but with everything becoming more corporate it feels like I could easily get shafted in one way or another However because I spent these years being the good employee and doing what needed to be done instead of what was best for my own experience I think it may be hard for me to get a DS job at another org Im hoping to get some perspective from all of you more seasoned professionals",15,13,2024-12-30 00:27:18,datascience,33,6477

Since I have the actual postimplementation usage now I can use it to find the cumulative differenceresidual

But my question is since the model is trained on the preimplementation data doesnt it make sense for the residual error to be high against the counter factual

The data points in preimplementation are mostly even across the lower and higher boundary and Its clear that there are more data points in the lower boundaries in the postimplementation but not sure how I would correctly test this I want to understand the direction so was thinking about using MBE Mean Bias Deviation

1hmuob8,Regression on multiple independent variable,"Hello everyone

Ive come across a use case thats got me stumped and Id like your opinion

I have around 1 million pieces of data representing the profit of various projects over a period of time Each project has its ID its profits at the date the date and a few other independent variables such as the project manager city etc

So I have projects over years with monthly granularity Several projects can be running simultaneously

Id like to be able to predict a projects performance at a specific date based on profits

The problem Ive encountered is that each project only lasts 1 year on average which means we have 12 data points per project so its impossible to do LSTM per project As far as I know you cant generalise LSTM for a case like mine similar periods of time for different projects

How do you build a model that could generalise the prediction of the benefits of a project over its lifecycle

What Ive done for the moment is classic regression xgboost decision tree with variables such as the age of the project in months the date the benefits over M1 M6 M12 Ive chosen 1 or 0 as the target variable positive or negative margin at the current month

Im afraid that regression wont be enough to capture more complex trends lagged trend especially Which kind of model would you advise me to go  Am I on a good direction",31,17,2024-12-26 18:34:32,datascience,43,1333
1hng96m,Puppy organize your 2025 python projects,"TLDR

 is a transparent wrapper around pixi and uv with simple APIs and recipes for using them to help write reproducible futureproof scripts and notebooks

 From 0 to rich toolset in one command

Start in an empty folder


curl fsSL   bash


installs python and dependencies in complete isolation from any existing python on your system  Mix and match URL query params to specify python version tools and venvs to create

The above also installs puppys CLI pup help

 CLI  kind of like uvlite
 pup add myenv pkg1 pkg2 install packages to myenv folder using uv
 pup list view whats installed across all projects
 pup clone and pup sync clone and build external repos must have buildable pyprojecttoml files

 Pup as a Module  no more notebook kernels

The original motivation for writing puppy was to simplify handling kernels but you might just not need them at all  Activatecreatemodify kernels interactively with


import pup
pupfetchmyenv   activate  packages in myenv are now importable
pupfetchmyenv pkg1 pkg2   install and activate  equivalent to pup add myenv pkg1 pkg2  


Of course youre welcome to use uv pip install but after 10 times its liable to get messy


 Target Audience

Loosely defining 2 personas

1 Getting Started with Python or herding folks who are
   1 puppy is the easiest way to go from 0 to modern python  onecommand installer that lets you specify python version venvs to build repos to clone  getting everyone from 0 to 1 in an easy and standardized way
   2 if youre confused about virtual environments and notebook kernels and install full jupyter into every project

2 Competent  check out MultiPuppyVerse and Where Pixi Shines sections
   1 you have 10 work and hobby projects going at the same time and need a better way to organize them for packaging deployment or even to find stuff 6 months later
   2 you need support for conda and nonpython stuff  you have many fastmoving external and internal dependencies  check out pup clone and pup sync workflows and dockerized examples


 Filesystem is your friend

Puppy recommends a sensible folder structure where each outer folder houses one and only one python executable  in isolation from each other and any other python on your system Pup is tied to a python executable that is installed by Pixi along with projectlevel tools like Jupyter conda packages and nonpython tools NodeJS make etc Puppy commands work the same from anywhere within this folder

The inner folders are gitready projects defined by pyprojecttoml with projectspecific packages handled by uv




  puphome   python 312 lives here
     publicproject
        git   this folder may be a git repo see pup clone
        venv
        pyprojecttoml
     env2
        venv   this one is in pregit development
        pyprojecttoml
     pixitoml

     pixitoml
     puppy
  pup313beta   313 here
      env5
      pixitoml
      puppy


Puppy embraces explicit is better than implicit from the Zen of python it logs what its doing with absolute paths so that you always know where you are and how you got there



PS Ive benefited a great deal from the many peoples OSS work  now trying to pay it forward The ideas laid out in puppys README and implementation have come together after many years of working in different orgs where average how do you rate yourself in python ranged from zero Excel 4ever to highly sophisticated The matter of how do we build stuff is kind of never settled and this is my take

1hmdpjm,Nontechnical job alternatives for former data scientist,"Some context I have a PhD in a hard science and I worked as a data scientist at a medical company for about 4 years and learned quite a bit and felt overall useful from machine learning to stats reports dashboards and python writing I have good social and communication skills as well though they were not needed at my position as data scientist

However I felt like the amount of work and the nature of work just wasnt a match for me it felt like manual labour except with my brain Constant and never ending work and problem solving  no where near as difficult as the graduate work but much more abundant and relentless At some point I guess you could say burnout occurred I dont mind problem solving and writing code but at a human pace with intellectual freedom Has anyone been in my situation What sort of jobs aside from management did you transition to If anyone knows of any specific roles or advice please do share I would be happy to provide more context if necessary

1hk7uvs,You Get a Dataset and Need to Find a Good Model Quickly in Hours or Days whats your strategy,"Typical Scenario Your friend gives you a dataset and challenges you to beat their models performance They dont tell you what they did but they provide a single CSV file and the performance metric to optimize

Assumptions
 Almost always tabular data so no need learning needed
 The dataset is typically smallish 100k rows 100 columns so it fits into memory
 Its always some kind of classificationregression sometimes time series forecasting
 The data is generally ready for modeling minimal cleaning needed
 Single data metric to optimize if they dont have one I force them to pick one and only one
 No additional data is available
 You have 12 days to do your best
 Maybe theres a hold out test set or maybe youre optimizing repeated kfold crossvalidation

Ive been in this situation perhaps a few dozen times over the years Typically its friends of friends typically its a work prototype or a grad student project sometimes its paid work Always I feel like my honor is on the line so I go hard and dont sleep for 2 days Have you been there

Heres how I typically approach it

1 Establish a Test Harness If theres a hold out test set I do a traintest split sensitivity analysis and find a ratio that preserves dataperformance distributions high correlation no statistical difference in means If theres no holdout set I ask them to evaluate their model if they have one using 3x10fold cv and save the result Sometimes I want to know their result sometimes not Having a target to beat is very motivating
2 Establish a Baseline Start with dummy models get a baseline performance Anything above this has skill
3 Spot Checking Run a suite of all scikitlearn models with default configs and default sensible data prep pipelines
	 Repeat with  asuite grid of standard configs for all models
	 Spot check more advanced models in third party libs like GBM libs xgboost catboost lightgbm superlearner imbalanced learn if needed etc
	 I want to know what the performance frontier looks like within a few hours and what looks good out of the box
4 Hyperparameter Tuning Focus on models that perform well and use grid search or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning I setup background gridrandom searches to run when I have nothing else going on Ill try some bayes optsome tpotauto sklearn etc to see if anything interesting surfaces
5 Pipeline Optimization Experiment with data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines Sometimes you find that a lesser used transform for an unlikely model surfaces something interesting
6 Ensemble Methods Combine topperforming models using stackingvotingaveraging I schedule this to run every 30 min and to try look for diverse models in the result set ensemble them together and try and squeeze out some more performance
7 Iterate Until Time Runs Out Keep refining and experimenting based on the results There should always be some kind of hyperparameterpipelineensemble optimization running as background tasks Foreground is for wild ideas I dream up Perhaps a 5050 split of cores or 3070 or 2080 if Im onto something and need more compute

Not a ton of time for EDAfeature engineering I might circle back after we have the performance frontier mapped and the optimizers are grinding Things are calmer I have something to show by then and can burn a few hours on creating clever features

I dump all configs  results into an sqlite db and have a flask CRUD app that allows me to searchsummarize the performance frontier I dont use tools like mlflow and friends because they didnt really exist when I started doing this a decade ago Maybe its time to switch things up Also they dont do the continuous optimization thing I need as far as I know

I rehack my scripts for each project Theyre a mess Oh well I often dream of turning this into an auto ml like service just to make my life easier in the future 

What is or would be your strategy in this situation How do you maximize results in such a short timeframe

Would you do anything differently or in a different order

Where is the distinction Can someone be both At large companies does it matter

When I look up ML pipelines on goole I get stuff like kubeflow pipelines or vertex ai pipelines so here is my first question

1 Are these pipeline tools supposed to be run in productiononline like in the use case I just described or are they meant to build ML pipelines for model training preprocessing data training a model and building a docker with the model weights example that are scheduled every so often 

  
It feels like these tools are not what I want because they seem to be aimed at building models and not serving them



After some googling I realized one good option would be to use Ray with Kubernetes They allow for model composition and allow for node configuration for each task which is exactly what I was looking for but my second question is 

2 What else could I use for this task

Plain kubernetes seems to be another option but more complex at setting up it seems weird to me that there are no more tools for this purpose multi model serving with different hardware requirements unless I can do this with kubeflow or vertex ai pipelines",11,10,2024-12-22 16:18:02,datascience,21,1533

This year I joined a project where the team is dominated by statisticians and economists Sounds like a data science dream team right Not so fast It feels like I hopped into a time machine and landed in the 90s Git Never heard of it Instead weve got the oldschool hierarchy of scriptv1 scriptfinalversion1 scriptfinalversion2 all the way to scriptfinalversionn Its a wild ride

Code reviews Absolutely nonexistent Every script is its own handcrafted masterpiece riddled with what I can only describe as surprise features in the preprocessing pipeline Bugs arent bugs apparently If you just pay close attention and read your code twice youll see theres no issue they tell me Uh sure I dont trust a single output right now because I know that behind every analysis bugs are having the party of their lives

1hjc9e0,Doctorate in quantitative marketing  marketing worth it,"Ill be graduating with my MS stats in the spring and then working as a data scientist within the ad tech  retail  marketing space My current Ms thesis despite it being statistics causal inference focused its rooted in applications within business and my advisors are statsmarketing folks in the business school

After my first year of graduate school I immediately knew a PhD n statistics would not be for me That degree is really for me not as interesting as Im not obsessive about knowing the inner details and theory behind statistics and want to create more theory Im motivated towards applications in business marketing and data science settings 

Topics of interest of mine have been how statistical methods have been used in the marketing space and its intersection with modern machine learning

I decided that Id take a job as a data scientist post graduation to build some experience and frankly make some money

A few things Ive thought about regarding my career trajectory

1 Build a niche skillset as a data scientist within the industry within marketingexperimentation and try and get to a staff DS in FAANG experimentation type roles

 a lot of my masters thesis literature review was on topics like causal inference and online experimentation These types of roles in industry would be something Id like to work in 


2 After 34 yo experience in my current marketing DS role go back to academia at a top tier business school and do a PhD in quantitative marketing or marketing with a focus on publishing research regarding statistical methods for marketing applications

 Ive read through a lot of the research focus of a lot of different quant marketing PhD programs and they seem to align with my interests My current Ms thesis in ways to estimate CATE functions and heterogenous treatment effect and these are generally of interest in marketing PhD programs

 Ive always thought working in an academic setting would give me more freedom to work on problems that interest me rather than be limited to the scope of industry If I were to go this route Id try and make tenure at an R1 business school


Id like to hear your thoughts on both of these pathways and weigh in on

1 Which of these sounds better given my goals

2 Which is the most practical

3 For anyone whose done a PhD in quantitative marketing and or PhD in marketing with an emphasis in quantitative methods what that was like and if its worth doing especially if I got into a top business school",28,17,2024-12-21 15:37:45,datascience,55,2476

1hhs47t,Looking for Applied Examples or Learning Resources in Operations Research and Statistical Modeling,"Hi all 

Im a working data scientist and I want to study Operations Research and Statistical Modeling with a focus on chemical manufacturing 

Im looking for learning resources that include applied examples as part of the learning path Alternatively a simple beginnerfriendly use case with a solution pathway would work as well  I can always pick up the theory on my own in fact most of what I found was theory without any practice examples  or several months long courses with way too many other topics included

Im limited in the time I can spend so each topic should fit into a halfday max 1 day of learning The goal here is not to become an expert but to get a foundational skilllevel where I can confidently find and conduct use cases without too much external handholding Upskilling for the future senior title basically 

Topics are

  Linear Programming LP eg Resource allocation cost minimization

  Integer Programming IP eg Scheduling batch production

 Bayesian Statistics
    
 Monte Carlo Simulation eg Risk and uncertainty analysis
    
 Stochastic Optimization Decisionmaking under uncertainty
    
 Markov Decision Processes MDPs Sequential decisionmaking eg maintenance strategies

 Time Series Analysis eg forecasting demand for chemical products

 Game Theory eg Pricing strategies competitive dynamics

Examples or datasets related to chemical production or operations are a plus but not strictly necessary

Only reason why Im hesitant is that Ive been focusing on LLM work for a while and it doesnt seem like thats what the Fraud space does

To sum it up

1 Is there a ton of red tapecomplianceMRM work with Fraud models
2 With an increase of Fraud losses every year is this an area thatll be a hot commoditygood to get experience with
3 Can you really do LLM work in this space The VP I interviewed with said that the space was going to do GenAI in a few years but when I asked him questions on what that meant to him he had no clue but wanted to get into it
4 Is realtime data used to decline transactions instead of just detection

1hgllx0,Sales Forecasting for optimizing resource allocation minimize waste maximize sales,"Hi All

To break up the monotony of muh job market bad I sympathize dont worry I wanted to get some input from people here about a problem we come across a lot where I work  Curious what some advice would be

So I work for a client that has lots of transactions of low value  We have TONS of data going back more than a decade for the client and weve recenlty solved some major organizational challenges which means we can do some really interesting stuff with it

They really want to improve their forecasting but one challenge I noted was that the data we would be training our algorithms on is affected by their attempts to control and optimize which were often based on voodoo  Their stock becomes waste pretty quickly if its not distributed properly  So the data doesnt really reflect how much profit could have been made because of the clients own attempts to optimize their profits  Demand is being estimated poorly in other words so the actual sales are of questionable value for training if I were to just use mean squared error median squared error because just matching the dynamics of previous sales cycles does not actually optimize the problem

I have a couple solutions to this and I want the communities opinion

  
1 Build a novel optimization algorithm that incorporates waste as a penalty    
I am wondering if this already exists somewhere or 

  
2 Smooth the data temporally enough and maximize on profit not sales

Rather than optimizing on sales daily we could for instance predict week by week this would be a more reasonable approach because stock has to be sent out on a particular day in anticipation of being sold  

  
3 Use reinforcement learning here or generative adversarial networks

I was thinking of having a network trained to minimize waste and another designed to maximize sales and have them compete in a game to find the best actions  Minimizing waste would involve making it negative

  
4 Should I cluster the stores beforehand and train models to predict based on the subclusters this could weed out bias in the data

I was considering that for storelevel predictions it may be useful to have an unbiased sample  This would mean training on data that has been down sampled or upsampled to for certain outlet types 

  
Lastly any advice on particular ML approaches would be helpful was currently considering MAMBA for this as it seems to be fairly computationally efficient and highly accurate  Explain ability is not really a concern for this task

I look forward to your thoughts a criticism please share resources papers videos etc that may be relevant",16,28,2024-12-17 21:41:16,datascience,82,2600

1hfk7ah,Finetuning  synthetic data example creating 9 fine tuned models from scratch in 18 minutes,"TLDR I built Kiln a new free tool that makes finetuning LLMs easy In this example I create 9 finetuned models including Llama 3x Mixtral and GPT4omini in just 18 minutes for less than 6 total cost This is completely from scratch and includes task definition synthetic dataset generation and model deployment

The codebase is all on GitHub

 Walkthrough

For the example I created 9 models in 18 minutes of work not including waiting for trainingdatagen Theres a walkthrough of each step in the finetuning guide but the summary is

 2 mins Define task goals and schema
 9 mins Synthetic data generation create 920 highquality examples using topic trees large models chain of thought and interactive UI
 5 mins dispatch 9 fine tuning jobs Fireworks Llama 32 1b3b11b Llama 31 8b70b Mixtral 8x7b OpenAI GPT 4omini  4o and Unsloth Llama 32 1b3b
 2 mins deploy models and test they work

 Results

The result was small models that worked quite well when the base models previously failed to produce the correct style and structure The overall cost was less than 6 excluding GPT 4o which was 16 and probably wasnt necessary The smallest model Llama 32 1B is about 10x faster and 150x cheaper than the models we used during synthetic data generation 

 Guide

I wrote a detailed finetuning guide covering more details around deployment running fully locally with UnslothOllama exporting to GGUF data strategies and next steps like evals

However someone recently asked me a question that I hadnt given much thought to before whats the point of testing machine learning model knowledge during interviews for nonresearch data science roles

Interview questions about model knowledge often include the following especially if a candidate claims to have experience with these models

 whats the difference between bagging and boosting 
 whether LightGBM uses leafwise splitting or levelwise splitting
 whats the underlying assumptions of linear regression

I learned these concepts because Im genuinely interested in understanding how models work But coming back to the question How important is it to have deep technical knowledge of machine learning models for someone who isnt in a research position and primarily uses these tools to solve business problems

From my experience knowing how models learn from data has occasionally helped me identify issues during the model training process more quickly But I couldnt come up with a convincing argument to justify why it is fair to test this knowledge other than the candidate should know it if they are using it

The possibility of UHCs actuarial science analysts and Data Scientists developing models to contribute to the strategy of increased profits and increased denials should be questioned And I know denial rates arent apples to apples as back office rev cycle management people could wrongfully code a claim which can cause it to be denied Im talking more from a targeted perspective Actuaries that work in insurance are very smart but I want to get some insight about the specifics of what goes on from a health insurance perspective when they are denying a claim

Its now time to choose the classification threshold This will clearly depend on the use case and the cost benefits associated with true positives false positives etc 

Often I see people advising to choose a threshold by looking at metrics such precision and recall 

What I dont see very often is people explicitly defining relative or absolute if possible costs benefits of each cell in the confusion matrix or more precisely the action that will be taken as a result For example a true positive is worth 1000 a false positive 500 and the other cells 0 

You then optimise the threshold based on maximum benefit using a costthreshold curve The precision and recall can also be reported but they are secondary to the benefit optimisation and not used directly in the choice I find this much more intuitive and is my goto

While I am okay with statistics  maths I am not at the level of the people that created this package nor do I know anyone that would be in my immediate circle The tested JAGS and untested STAN models are freely provided along with their papers

1i7tmfs,D Encoding mix symbols  numeric tokens,"I find myself often thinking about tokenizers for problems where the input space is a vast array of numbers associated to symbols

A good example here would be proteomics data where one might often have dozens of thousands to millions of types of proteins  and a quantity associated with each

There are a lot of clever ways to feed this sort of data into a model but what I care about is more so training a w2v style tokenizer that is able to look for similarities between semantic and numeric pairs

  
An example

ProteinA50k500k  only occurs happens when ProteinB20k40k but not always

ProteinA 050k  seems uncorrelated with ProteinB in any numeric range

So ideally Id want a tokenizer that when I apply say cosine similarity or some other function I dont mind if the tokens make sense only with more complex distance functions

Pa20k sim Pb45k  low

Pa80k sim Pb5k  low

We built Jaqpot at our research lab because we needed a simple way to deploy machine learning models through APIs without dealing with the deployment headaches Basically you train your model sklearn pytorch geometric and with a few lines of code it gets wrapped in an API you can call from your applications or visit on our dashboard

Example in Python

    from jaqpotpymodels import SklearnModel
    from jaqpotpy import Jaqpot
    
     Train your model as usual
    model  SklearnModeldatasetdataset modelLogisticRegression
    modelfit
    
     Deploy it
    jaqpot  Jaqpot
    jaqpotlogin
    modeldeployonjaqpot
        nameMy Model
        descriptionSimple classifier
    

Then you can call it from Python

    prediction  jaqpotpredictsyncmodelidmodelid datasetinputdata

or Java

    Dataset prediction  jaqpotApiClientpredictSyncmodelId inputData

Some key points

 Free to use research project funded through our lab
 Supports scikitlearn models and pytorch geometric
 Python and JavaKotlin SDKs available
 Handles all the ONNX conversion and API setup
 Private or public model deployment options
 Includes specialized features for predictive modeling in chemistry and materials science

Were making this available to researchers and developers while we have funding to run the infrastructure We want to see how people actually use it and what features they need Long term well probably need usage tiers to keep the servers running but for now its completely free and opensource

Check out our documentation or try it at appjaqpotorg if youre interested

Happy to answer any questions

1i7doq7,R Learning Complex Knowledge from Raw Video VideoWorlds Success in Go and Robotic Control,"This paper presents an approach for learning world knowledge directly from unlabeled video data through a selfsupervised framework called VideoWorld The core technical contribution is a multistage architecture that processes videos to extract both visual and temporal relationships without requiring manual annotation

Key technical points
 Uses contrastive learning between video segments to capture temporal dynamics
 Implements crossmodal alignment between visual and motion features
 Employs temporal consistency learning to understand event sequences
 Introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism for longrange dependencies

Results demonstrate improvement over existing methods
 12 increase in video QA performance on HowTo100M
 15 better temporal relationship understanding on ActivityNet
 8 improvement in nextframe prediction tasks
 Effective zeroshot transfer to unseen video domains

I think this approach could significantly change how we train video understanding models By removing the need for expensive manual labeling we could potentially train on much larger and more diverse video datasets Im particularly interested in how this could improve robotic learning systems that need to understand physical interactions and causality

The results suggest good potential for realworld applications though I think there are still important challenges around computational efficiency and handling of abstract concepts that need to be addressed

1i727qm,R FutureGuided Learning A Predictive Approach To Enhance TimeSeries Forecasting,"Hello everybody My name is Skye and I am the first author of this work This paper demonstrates that forecasting and event prediction can be enhanced by taking inspiration from the brain specifically predictive coding theory I am posting the abstract code and arXiv link for anybody curious Please feel free to leave any comments below as this is my first fulllength paper and I would appreciate any feedback

Abstract Accurate timeseries forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains yet deep learning models often struggle to capture longterm dependencies and adapt to data distribution drifts over time We introduce FutureGuided Learning an approach that enhances timeseries event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding Our method involves two models a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model effectively minimizing surprise and adapting to shifts in the data distribution by aligning its predictions with actual future outcomes This feedback loop allows the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters focusing on persistent features despite changes in the data We validate our approach on a variety of tasks demonstrating a 448 increase in AUCROC for seizure prediction using EEG data and a 487 reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism adaptable to data drift FutureGuided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to timeseries forecasting

1i6os2n,R Multivariate Time Series Prediction with Transformers,"I am working on a model that I want to be able to take in a multivariate time series of weather and river height data and output a series of predictions for one of the river gauge heights Essentially I feed in timesteps 2040 and expect to receive timesteps 4161 I have previously been using an LSTM for this but I got pretty subpar results with several different architectures Im now looking at using a transformer encoder network and I have this recurring issue I cant seem to figure out

For almost any context length model size positional encoding training time etc the model seems to be incapable of distinguishing between timesteps on the outputs It always learns to predict a good average for the gauge height across the timesteps but theres no variation in its outputs On an example case where the target gauge height is 02 03 07 08 06 it would output something like 04 045 04 045 05

In fact the model performs almost exactly the same without any positional encoding at all

Heres an example of what an output might look like from several continuous tests

Several prediction lines showing a similar trend regardless of actual position on the graph

I have tried both relative positional encoding and absolute positional encoding and adjusting the loss function to add a term that focuses on the slope between timesteps but I cant seem to enforce differentiation between timesteps

The extra loss term

Heres a diagram of my architecture thats more explicit

Image containing transformer network architecture including a linear projection positional encoding transformer encoder and another projection in series

I understand that this isnt exactly a common use case or architecture for this use case but Im not sure why the model isnt capable of making the distinction between timesteps Ive considered adding a bidirectional LSTM before the final projection to force time differentiation

For reference I have found that this model performs well with a dModel of 64 feedForward of 128 6 layers and 8 heads The other term in the loss function is a standard MSE Also I dont apply masking as all of the inputs should be used to calculate the outputs in my case

I cant post much code as this is related to my job but I would like to learn more about what is wrong with my approach

1i44h5v,D I hate softmax,"This is a half joke and the core concepts are quite easy but Im sure the community will cite lots of evidence to both support and dismiss the claim that softmax sucks and actually make it into a serious and interesting discussion

What is softmax Its the operation of applying an elementwise exponential function and normalizing by the sum of activations
What does it do intuitively One point is that outputs sum to 1 Another is that the the relatively larger outputs become more relatively larger wrt the smaller ones big and small activations are teared apart

One problem is you never get zero outputs if inputs are finite eg without masking you cant attribute 0 attention to some elements
The one that makes me go crazy is that for most of applications magnitudes and ratios of magnitudes are meaningful but in softmax they are not softmax cares for differences
Take softmax01 09 and softmax19 or softmax1000110009 Which do you think are equal In what applications that is the more natural way to go

Numerical instabilities strange gradients embedding norms are all things affected by such simple cores Of course in the meantime softmax is one of the workhorses of deep learning it does quite a job

1i3t4c3,P Building an Reinforcement Learning Agent to play The Legend of Zelda,"A year go I started trying to use PPO to play the original Legend of Zelda and I was able to train a model to beat the first boss after a few months of work I wanted to share the project just for show and tell Id love to hear feedback and suggestions as this is just a hobby project I dont do this for a living The code for that lives in the originaldesign branch of my Triforce repo Im currently tinkering with new designs so the main branch is much less stable

Heres a video of the agent beating the first dungeon which was trained with 5000000 steps At 38 seconds you can see it learned that its invulnerable at the screen edge and it exploits that to avoid damage from a projectile At 53 seconds it steps up to avoid damage from an unblockable projectile even though it takes a 006 penalty for moving the wrong way taking damage would be a larger penalty At 55 seconds it walks towards the rock projectile to block it And so on lots of little things the model does is easy to miss if you dont know the game inside and out

As a TLDR heres an early version of my new single model This doesnt make it quite as far but if you watch closely its combat is already far better and is only trained on 320000 steps 6 of the steps the first model was trained on

This is pretty far along from my very first model

 Original Design

I got the original project working using stablebaseliness PPO and default neural network Shared NatureCNN I believe SB was great to get started but ultimately stifling In the new version of the project Ive implemented PPO from scratch with torch with my own simple neural network similar to stablebaselines default Im playing with all kinds of changes and designs now that I have more flexibility and control Here is my rough original design

 Overall Strategy

My first pass through this project was basically imagine playing Zelda with your older sibling telling you where to go and what to do I give the model an objective vector which points to where I want it to go on the screen as a bird flies the agent still had to learn path finding to avoid damage and navigate around the map This includes either point at the nearest enemy I want it to kill or a NSEW vector if its supposed to move to the next room

Due a few limitations with stablebaselines especially around action masking I ended up training unique models for traversing the overworld vs the dungeon since they have entirely different tilesets I also trained a different model for when we have sword beams vs not In the video above you can see what model is being used onscreen

In my current project Ive removed this objective vector as it felt too much like cheating Instead I give it a onehot encoded objective move north to the next room pickup items kill enemies etc So far its working quite well without that crutch The new project also does a much better job of combat even without multiple models to handle beams vs not

 ObservationAction Space

Image  The standard neural network had a really tough time being fed the entire screen No amount of training seemed to help I solved this by creating a viewport around Link that keeps him centered This REALLY helped the model learn

I also had absolutely zero success with stacking frames to give Link a way to see enemyprojectile movement The model simply never trained with stablebaselines when I implemented frame stacking and I never figured out why I just added it to my current neural network and it seems to be working

Though my early experiments show that giving it 3 frames skipping two in between so frames curr curr3 curr6 doesnt really give us that much better performance It might if I took away some of the vectors Well see

Vectors  Since the model cannot see beyond its little viewport I gave the model a vector to the closest item enemy and projectile onscreen This made it so the model can shoot enemies across the room outside of its viewport My new model gives it multiple enemiesitemsprojectiles and I plan to try to use an attention mechanism as part of the network to see if I can just feed it all of that data

Information  It also gets a couple of oneoff datapoints like whether it currently has sword beams The new model also gives it a source room to help better understand dungeons where we have to backtrack and a onehot encoded objective

Action Space

My original project just has a few actions 4 for moving in the cardinal directions and 4 for attacking in each direction I also added bombs but never spent any time training it I had an idea to use masking to help speed up training IE if link bumps into a wall dont let him move in that direction again until he moves elsewhere as the model would often spend an entire memory buffer running headlong straight into a wall before an updatebetter to do it once and get a huge negative penalty which is essentially the same result but faster

Unfortunately SB made it really annoying architecturally to pass that info down to the policy layer I could have hacked it together but eventually I just reimplemented PPO and my own neural network so I could properly mask actions in the new version For example when we start training a fresh model it cannot attack when there arent enemies on screen and I can disallow it from leaving certain areas

The new model actually understands splitting swinging the sword short range vs firing sword beams as two different actions though I havent yet had a chance to fully train with the split yet

FrameskipCooldowns  In the game I dont use a fixed frame skip for actions Instead I use the internal ram state of game to know when Link is animation locked or not and only allow the agent to take actions when its actually possible to give meaningful input to the game This greatly sped up training We also force movement to be between tiles on the game map This means that when the agent decides to move it loses control for longer than a player woulda player can make more split second decisions This made it easier to implement movement rewards though and might be something to clean up in the future

 Other interesting details

Pathfinding  To facilitate rewards the original version of this project used A to pathfind from link to what he should be doing Heres a video of it in action This information wasnt giving to the model directly but instead the agent would only be given the rewards if it exactly followed that path or the transposed version of it It would also pathfind around enemies and not walk through them

This was a nightmare though The corner cases were significant and pushing Link towards enemies but not into them was really tricky The new verison just uses a wavefront algorithm I calculate a wave from the tiles we want to get to outwards then make sure we are following the gradient Also calculating the A around enemies every frame even with caching was super slow Wavefront was faster especially because I give the new model no special rewards for walking around enemiesfaster to compute and it has to learn from taking damage or not

Either way the both the old and new models successfully learned how to pathfind around danger and obstacles with or without the cheaty objective vector

Rewards  I programmed very dense rewards in both the old and new model At basically every step the model is getting rewarded or punished for something I actually have some ideas I cant wait to try out to make the rewards more sparse Or maybe we start with dense rewards for the first training then finetune the model with sparser rewards Well see

Predicting the Future  Speaking of rewards One interesting wrinkle is that the agent can do a lot of things that will eventually deal damage but not on that frame For example when Link sets a bomb it takes several seconds before it explodes killing things This can be a massive reward or penalty since he spent an extremely valuable resource but may have done massive damage PPO and other RL propagates rewards backwards of course but that spike in reward could land on a weird frame where we took damage or moved in the wrong direction

I probably could have just not solved that problem and let it shake out over time but instead I used the fact that we are in an emulator to just see what the outcome of every decision is When planting a bomb shooting sword beams etc we let the game run forward until impact then rewind time and reward the agent appropriately continuing on from when we first paused This greatly speeds up training even if its expensive to do this savestate play forward restore state

Neural Networks  When I first started this project knowing very little about ML and RL I thought most of my time would be tuning the shape of the neural network that we are using In reality the default provided by stablebaselines and my eventual reimplemnentation has been enough to make massive progress Now that I have a solid codebase though I really want to revisit this  Id like to see if trying CoordConvs and similar networks might make the viewport unncessary

 Less interesting detailsthoughts

Hyperparameters  Setting the entropy coefficinet way lower helped a TON in training stable models  My new PPO implementation is way less stable than stablebaselines ha imagine that but still converges most of the time

Infinite Rewards  As with all reinforcement learning if you give some way for the model to get infinite rewards it will do just that and nothing else I spent days or maybe weeks tweaking reward functions to just get it to train and not find a spot on the wall it could hump for infinite rewards  Even just neutral rewards like 05 moving forward and 05 for moving backwards would often result in a model that just stepped left then right infinitely  There has to be a real reward or punishment nonneutral for forward progress

Debugging Rewards  In fact building a rewards debugger was the only way I made progress in this project  If you are tackling something this big do that very early

StableRetro is pretty great  Couldnt be happier with the clean design for implementing emulation for AI

Torch is Awesome  My early versions heavily used numpy and relied on stablebaselines with its multiproc parallelization support It worked great Moving the project over to torch was night and day though It gave me so much more flexibility instant multithreading for matrix operations I have a pretty beefy computer and Im almost at the same steps per second as 20 proc stableretronumpy

 Future Ideas

This has already gone on too long I have some ideas for future projects but maybe Ill just make them another post when I actually do them

1i44wlr,P Launch a Federation of robots that collaboratively train an object manipulation model,"Using Flower  and LeRobot I put together a  quickstart example that demonstrates how to train a diffusion model collaboratively across 10 individual nodes each with its own dataset partition This example uses thepusht dataset where the task is to move a letter T object on top of another that is to remain static

The example its pretty easy to run and can do so efficiently if you have access to a recent gaming GPU Although the diffusion model only takes 2GB of VRAM of course you can decide to scale it up the compute needed to train them isnt negligible For context running the example until convergence takes 40mins on a dual RTX 3090 setup It takes about 30rounds of federated learning FL to do so although the example runs for 50 rounds by default

Evaluation of the global model at different rounds After just a few rounds of collaboratively AI training the model successfully completes the task and it does so pretty fast

  
The example runs each noderobot in simulation by default ie each node is a Python process and there is some clever scheduling to run the jobs in a resourceaware manner But it is straight forward to run it as a real deployment where each node is for example a different device eg NVIDIA Jetson If someone is interested in doing this checkout the links added at the bottom of the example readme

1i40viz,D Dynamic NeuronControllerBased Transformer Architecture Feedback Wanted,"Dynamic NeuronControllerBased Transformer Architecture by Shanmukh Ram

 Abstract

This white paper presents an innovative architecture that integrates dynamic neuroncontroller systems with transformer models to create a continuously adaptive and resourceefficient AI framework The proposed architecture utilizes neuron or batch controllers to dynamically adjust the weights and operations of a shared transformer architecture in real time

By responding to signals generated by individual or grouped neurons the system continuously adapts to changing demands This adaptability enables efficient multitasking and optimizes resource sharing ensuring high performance across diverse contexts These features establish the architecture as a groundbreaking innovation in AI unlocking advancements in applications such as general intelligence personalized systems and multiagent collaboration

 1 Introduction

 11 Background

Transformer architectures have revolutionized natural language processing and other domains owing to their scalability attention mechanisms and ability to model longrange dependencies However transformers remain largely static posttraining with finetuning or retraining required to adapt to new tasks or shifting environments

 12 Motivation

Realworld applications often involve dynamic and unpredictable environments Traditional transformer models though powerful are inefficient in adapting to realtime changes without significant retraining This gap motivates the design of a system where neurons act as adaptive controllers dynamically modifying the transformers behavior to optimize performance across varying tasks and inputs

 2 Proposed Architecture

 21 Core Components

The architecture consists of the following core components

1 NeuronControllers
    Independent neurons or batches of neurons act as dynamic agents within the system controlling and optimizing the transformers performance These controllers receive input signals from various sources including realtime environmental data user feedback or taskspecific objectives Upon processing these inputs the controllers generate precise control signals to dynamically modify transformer parameters such as attention weights layer activations or embeddings For instance in a natural language processing task the controllers might adjust attention weights to focus on critical phrases in a document ensuring more accurate summarization Similarly in image recognition tasks layer activations could be optimized to emphasize edges or textures improving classification accuracy
    These targeted adjustments significantly enhance the systems ability to adapt to diverse tasks while maintaining high performance and efficiency This dynamic adjustment ensures the system remains highly adaptive continuously optimizing its responses to suit specific tasks or contexts
2 Shared Transformer Framework
    A modular transformer architecture forms the backbone of the system meticulously crafted to support realtime adjustments to its operational parameters This modularity allows each core component such as attention heads transformer layers or embeddings to be dynamically reconfigured based on control signals generated by neuroncontroller batches By enabling realtime adaptability the system ensures that computational resources can be scaled efficiently or concentrated on specific areas of importance depending on the complexity and requirements of the task For instance attention heads may be activated selectively for highpriority inputs while layers or embeddings can be modified dynamically to finetune taskspecific outputs This approach not only enhances scalability but also optimizes performance making the architecture capable of handling both simple and complex tasks with remarkable efficiency
3 Feedback Loop
    The architecture integrates a continuous feedback mechanism wherein the transformers outputs are systematically analyzed and fed back to the neuroncontrollers This iterative process allows the neuroncontrollers to refine their strategies based on realtime performance metrics and contextual outcomes By dynamically adjusting control parameters the system ensures alignment with evolving task objectives and operational efficiency This feedback loop not only enhances adaptability but also fosters a robust learning environment where both controllers and the transformer progressively improve in tandem
    This loop refines the controllers strategies in real time ensuring constant performance improvement and alignment with task objectives
    By iteratively optimizing both the controllers and the transformer the system achieves a closedloop learning environment
4 Coordinator Mechanism
    A centralized or decentralized coordinator mechanism is designed to ensure seamless interactions among multiple neuroncontroller batches This mechanism prioritizes resource allocation and balances task assignments mitigating potential conflicts that may arise when neuron batches manage separate transformers or collaborate on shared tasks By enabling effective coordination the architecture prevents inefficiencies and ensures that all tasks are executed optimally maintaining synergy across the entire system

 22 Key Features

1 Dynamic Weight Adjustment

Dynamic weight adjustment represents the core capability of the system where controllers finetune specific transformer weights in real time These adjustments are informed by contextual signals which include environmental data user feedback and taskspecific objectives For example in autonomous driving the controllers can adjust attention weights to prioritize critical inputs like pedestrian detection over less immediate data such as road signage in clear weather In healthcare applications layer activations might be finetuned dynamically to focus on anomalies in medical imaging ensuring accurate diagnostics When an input signal is received the neuroncontrollers analyze it and generate precise commands to recalibrate the transformers internal parameters such as attention weights or activation thresholds This process ensures that the architecture adapts seamlessly to the demands of diverse tasks and dynamic environments The ability to perform these realtime optimizations not only enhances taskspecific performance but also maximizes resource efficiency as only the necessary components of the transformer are engaged at any given time This dynamic adaptability is crucial for handling complex realworld scenarios where static models would fail to perform optimally thereby positioning this system as a significant advancement in AI adaptability and responsiveness

1 BatchBased Control
    Groups of neurons manage different tasks or modules each acting as specialized agents to oversee specific functionalities within the system This allows simultaneous optimization across multiple frameworks by dynamically distributing computational resources and responsibilities For example one group of neurons may control language modeling tasks while another focuses on visionbased analysis enabling these processes to run concurrently without interfering with each other This approach enhances efficiency and ensures that the transformer system remains scalable and adaptable bringing the value of multitasking without compromising performance
2 TaskSpecific Adaptation
    Each neuron batch can specialize in controlling a subset of the transformer for taskspecific performance by dynamically focusing on the specific layers attention mechanisms or embeddings that are most relevant to the task For example in a multitask learning setup one neuron batch could finetune the transformers attention weights for language modeling while another batch might adjust embedding layers for visual data processing This specialization ensures that the system can effectively handle diverse tasks in parallel without sacrificing efficiency or performance By leveraging this dynamic specialization the architecture optimizes resource utilization minimizes interference between tasks and enhances the accuracy and responsiveness of each transformer subset to its assigned task
3 MultiAgent Collaboration
    Neuron batches play a pivotal role in enhancing the systems overall performance by engaging in collaborative or competitive dynamics tailored to complex multidimensional tasks For example in a multimodal AI system one neuron batch could specialize in processing textual data while another focuses on visual inputs Collaboration between these batches ensures that insights from both modalities are integrated effectively leading to more accurate and coherent outcomes such as in video summarization or multimedia content analysis Similarly competition among neuron batches could prioritize critical tasks ensuring timesensitive objectives like anomaly detection in realtime surveillance are addressed promptly These batches act as specialized agents dynamically adjusting their behaviors to maximize task outcomes based on the broader systems objectives For instance collaboration between neuron batches may involve sharing insights or control signals to optimize resource allocation across different sections of the transformer In contrast competitive dynamics could arise in scenarios where distinct neuron batches vie to prioritize their assigned tasks ensuring critical objectives receive adequate focus
    By allowing both collaboration and competition the architecture fosters a balance between efficiency and taskspecific precision This mechanism integrates seamlessly with the feedback and coordination systems ensuring that neuron batches remain aligned with the overarching goals of the system while dynamically optimizing their strategies The value of this approach lies in its ability to handle multitasking demands with enhanced adaptability and responsiveness making it an essential component of the architectures design

 4 Applications

 41 MultiTask Learning

Dynamic controllers empower a single transformer architecture to manage multiple tasks simultaneously by dynamically redistributing resources to optimize for each tasks specific requirements These controllers act as taskspecialized agents analyzing the contextual demands of each input and directing computational focus to the most relevant sections of the transformer such as attention heads embeddings or specific layers For example when handling a combination of natural language processing and visionbased tasks the dynamic controllers can assign priority resources to textual embeddings for language inputs while activating visionspecific modules for image data

This simultaneous multitask optimization ensures that each task benefits from the transformers shared architecture without compromising performance The ability to dynamically allocate resources not only reduces computational redundancy but also enhances scalability allowing the system to adapt seamlessly to complex realworld scenarios By maintaining taskspecific precision while sharing computational infrastructure this architecture represents a significant step forward in creating efficient and robust AI systems capable of managing diverse workloads

 42 Personalized Systems

Dynamic controllers allow the transformer to adapt its behavior to individual users or specific contexts enabling highly tailored and responsive applications By analyzing realtime user data such as preferences historical interactions or contextual inputs these controllers dynamically modify the transformers parameters to deliver personalized outputs For example in a virtual assistant application the controller might adjust the transformers attention mechanisms to prioritize the users current needs or focus on topics of interest based on prior interactions This capability ensures that the system evolves alongside the user providing a more engaging and effective experience The ability to personalize outputs in realtime is critical for applications in education healthcare and customer service where individualized solutions add significant value

 43 Collaborative AI

Neuroncontroller batches enhance the systems ability to handle complex multidimensional problems by fostering collaboration among multiple transformers For instance in a multimodal AI system integrating text images and audio one batch of neuroncontrollers could process and extract key textual information another batch could analyze visual data and a third could handle audio signals Collaboration ensures that insights from each modality are synthesized into a unified understanding significantly improving outcomes such as multimedia content analysis or realtime event summarization

This collaborative potential enables the system to leverage diverse data types effectively ensuring comprehensive and accurate results These controllers dynamically allocate resources and share insights between transformers enabling them to work together seamlessly For instance in multimodal AI applications that integrate text images and audio one transformer might specialize in processing textual data while another focuses on visual analysis

Through realtime communication and coordination the system ensures that insights from each modality contribute to a cohesive and accurate result This collaborative approach not only improves task performance but also enables the system to tackle problems that require integrated knowledge from multiple domains

 44 General Intelligence

The architectures dynamic adaptability realtime resource allocation and collaborative mechanisms represent a significant step toward achieving general artificial intelligence By allowing neuroncontroller batches to manage diverse tasks and contexts dynamically the system creates a foundation for crossdomain learning and decisionmaking Unlike traditional AI systems that require retraining for new tasks this architecture can rapidly adapt to novel scenarios demonstrating a level of flexibility and generalization that closely mirrors human intelligence The ability to integrate knowledge across tasks and respond effectively to unforeseen challenges positions this architecture as a cornerstone in the pursuit of general AI

Research should prioritize the development of neuroncontrollers capable of understanding higherlevel abstractions contextual nuances and complex task hierarchies By integrating advanced algorithms such as metalearning and neural architecture search these controllers can evolve into highly intelligent agents that adapt seamlessly to diverse and unforeseen challenges This advancement will make the system more robust in managing a wider array of applications

 62 Scaling to Larger Architectures

Efforts must be directed toward designing and managing larger systems that integrate multiple controllers and transformers However scaling such architectures presents significant challenges including increased computational overhead potential bottlenecks in communication between controllers and the risk of degraded performance in highly complex systems Addressing these limitations is crucial to unlock the full potential of this approach and ensure seamless scalability in realworld applications Techniques such as distributed computing modular design and sparse activations will be critical to maintain performance and efficiency at scale This scaling capability will empower the architecture to handle increasingly complex tasks across industries from healthcare diagnostics to autonomous systems

 63 Safety and Robustness

Ensuring the safety and reliability of dynamically adaptive systems is paramount Specific strategies to achieve this include the integration of robust adversarial defense mechanisms to counter malicious inputs the development of failsafe protocols to handle unexpected failures and the implementation of comprehensive ethical oversight frameworks Additionally employing techniques such as explainability in AI and realtime monitoring systems can ensure transparency and accountability further reinforcing the trustworthiness of these architectures This requires the implementation of failsafes ethical oversight mechanisms and robust adversarial defenses

By addressing these concerns the architecture can operate confidently in critical applications including finance defense and public safety For example in finance the system could dynamically adapt to market changes by prioritizing critical data streams for fraud detection or risk assessment In defense collaborative neuroncontroller batches could integrate intelligence from multiple data modalities such as satellite imagery intercepted communications and realtime ground reports to provide actionable insights for decisionmakers Similarly in public safety the architecture could manage resources dynamically during emergencies such as optimizing response times for disaster management or ensuring accurate predictions for crowd control Safetyfocused research will also ensure that the system remains compliant with evolving regulations and ethical standards

1i45h9r,D Fewshot Learning with prototypical networks  help to understand the concept,"Hi probably quite simple questions for those who know the concept but still tricky for me to realize

Lets say I have a dataset with 200 labeled samples and I have 10 classes However not all 200 examples contain all 10 classes but only some of them while the rest samples contain a combination of them Meaning that a sample might be labeled for classes 0 1 5 8 while another for 0 3 7 and so on Which also means that the prevalence of the classes varies a lot

How do I split my dataset for fewshot learning with prototypical networks Do I need to train and validate on samples that include all classes so the network learns to compute prototypes for every class Also given that the prevalence of the classes varies do I need to balance the sampling so it sees each class equally on the number of training and validation episodes

During testing do I need to include on my test set a few labeled samples for each class Can I do inference without any labeled samples Is that zeroshot learning Also can I train a model that generalizes to unseen classes during training

1i2q6t9,R Multimodal VisualizationofThought Enhancing MLLM Reasoning Through Visual Thinking,"The key innovation here is combining large language models with image generation to create a system that can visually think while solving problems The approach called Multimodal VisualizationofThought MVoT generates relevant visualizations during its reasoning process similar to how humans might sketch diagrams to better understand a problem

Main technical points
 System architecture integrates LLMs for reasoning with image generation models
 Uses spatialsemantic alignment to ensure generated visuals match reasoning steps
 Implements an iterative process where each reasoning step can trigger visualization
 Maintains consistency between visual and textual representations through multimodal chainofthought

Results
 12 improvement on visual reasoning benchmarks compared to baseline approaches
 Particularly strong performance on tasks involving spatial relationships
 Generated visualizations showed clear alignment with reasoning steps
 Works with different combinations of language and image generation models

I think this approach could meaningfully improve AI systems ability to reason about physical and spatial problems By incorporating visual thinking into the reasoning process we might see better performance on tasks that humans typically solve through visualization  from physics problems to architectural design However the computational overhead of generating images during reasoning could limit practical applications

I think the most interesting aspect is how this mimics human cognitive processes  we often sketch or visualize to understand complex problems This could lead to AI systems that reason in more intuitive and interpretable ways

TLDR New method combines language models with image generation to create AI systems that can think visually while reasoning showing 12 improvement on visual reasoning tasks

1i23zbo,P How I found  fixed 4 bugs in Microsofts Phi4 model,"Hey rMachineLearning Last week Microsoft released Phi4 a 14B opensource model that rivals OpenAIs GPT4omini I managed to find  fix 4 bugs impacting its output quality You might remember me previously from fixing 8 bugs in Googles Gemma model 

Im going to walk you through how I found  fixed the bugs Phi4s benchmarks were amazing however many users reported weird or just wrong outputs Since I maintain the opensource project called Unsloth finetuning LLMs 2x faster with 70 less VRAM with my brother I firstly tested Phi4 for inference and found many errors Our GitHub repo 

This time the model had no implementation issues unlike Gemma 2 but did have problems in the model card For my first inference run I randomly found an extra token which is obviously incorrect 2 eos tokens is never a good idea Also during more runs I found there was an extra assistant prompt which is once again incorrect And lastly from past experience with Unsloths bug fixes I already knew finetuning was wrong when I read the code

These bugs caused Phi4 to have some drop in accuracy and also broke finetuning runs Our fixes are now under review by Microsoft to be officially added to Hugging Face We uploaded the fixed versions to 

Heres a breakdown of the bugs and their fixes

1 Tokenizer bug fixes

The Phi4 tokenizer interestingly uses endoftext as the BOS beginning of sentence EOS end of sentence and PAD padding tokens The main issue is the EOS token is wrong  it should be imend Otherwise you will get imendendoftext in generations

2 Finetuning bug fixes

The padding token should be a designated pad token like in Llama finetunerightpadid or we can use an untrained token  for example we use dummy87 fixing infinite generations and outputs

3 Chat template issues

The Phi4 tokenizer always adds an assistant prompt  it should only do this if prompted by addgenerationprompt Most LLM serving libraries expect non auto assistant additions and this might cause issues during serving

We dive deeper into the bugs in our blog 

 Do our Fixes Work

Yes Our fixed Phi4 uploads show clear performance gains with even better scores than Microsofts original uploads on the Open LLM Leaderboard



Some redditors even tested our fixes to show greatly improved results in

 Example 1 Multiplechoice tasks



 Example 2 ASCII art generation



We also made a Colab notebook finetune Phi4 completely for free using Googles free Tesla T4 16GB GPUs 

Thank you for reading this long post and hope you all found this insightful If you have any questions please feel free to ask 

How I found the bugs

1 I first downloaded the original Phi4 from  and tested inference out Weirdly I found imstartassistantimsep to be appended at the even with addgenerationprompt  False in Hugging Face so I theorized there was a chat template problem Adding assistant prompts by default can break serving libraries
2 And yes  had by default added the assistant prompt  I first fixed this
3 I then found endoftext to be used for the BOS EOS and PAD tokens which is a common issue amongst models  I ignored the BOS since Phi4 did not have one anyways but changed the PAD token to dummy87 You can select any of the tokens since theyre empty and not trained This counteracts issues of infinite generations during finetuning
4 For Llamafication I used torchallclose to confirm all tensors are in fact equivalent I also used some fake random data to check all activations are also mostly similar bitwise I also uploaded the model to the HF Open LLM Leaderboard to confirm if the original Phi4 arch and the new Llamafied models are equivalent
5 Finally I verified all finetuning runs with Unsloth in a Colab Notebook to confirm all runs were correct",305,28,2025-01-15 18:22:48,MachineLearning,52,3705

Reproducing o1like MLLM","TLDR A reasoning multimodal model built from Qwen2VL72B Surprisingly beats QVQ in evals

Paper 

Abstract

Recently slowthinking reasoning systems built upon large language models LLMs have garnered widespread attention by scaling the thinking time during inference There is also growing interest in adapting this capability to multimodal large language models MLLMs Given that MLLMs handle more complex data semantics across different modalities it is intuitively more challenging to implement multimodal slowthinking systems  
To address this issue in this paper we explore a straightforward approach by finetuning a capable MLLM with a small amount of textual longform thought data resulting in a multimodal slowthinking system Virgo Visual reasoning with long thought We find that these longform reasoning processes expressed in natural language can be effectively transferred to MLLMs Moreover it seems that such textual reasoning data can be even more effective than visual reasoning data in eliciting the slowthinking capacities of MLLMs While this work is preliminary it demonstrates that slowthinking capacities are fundamentally associated with the language model component which can be transferred across modalities or domains This finding can be leveraged to guide the development of more powerful slowthinking reasoning systems We release our resources at this  URL

Highlights

We obtain approximately 5K long thought instruction instances distilled from two open slowthinking reasoning systems DeepSeekR1LitePreview 2 abbreviated as R1 and QwQ32Bpreview 3 abbreviated as QwQ The statistics of the collected instruction data are categorized by domain as follows math 37K science 09K code 02K and puzzle 01K 

After collecting instruction data for longform reasoning we finetune the base MLLM to emulate slowthinking reasoning behavior 

The second approach we explore is the direct distillation of multimodal long thought data from slowthinking MLLMs eg QVQ 

As another alternative approach we design a multistage tuning method for selfdistillation Specifically we first finetune the selected MLLM ie Qwen2VL72BInstruct on the textual long thought instruction set DT obtaining model M0 Next we use M0 to generate the visual long thought instruction set by selfdistillation DSD which can be subsequently used for finetuning the original MLLM

1i2lk5n,P AutoResearch A new opensource LLMdriven research automation tool,"Hello everyone

I recently developed a new opensource LLMdriven research automation tool called AutoResearch It can automatically conduct various tasks related to machine learning research the key function is

TopictoSurvey Automation  In one sentence it converts a topic or research question into a comprehensive survey of relevant papers It generates keywords retrieves articles for each keyword merges duplicate articles ranks articles based on their impacts summarizes the articles from the topic method to results and optionally checks code availability It also organizes and zips results for easy access

When searching for research papers the results from a search engine can vary significantly depending on the specific keywords used even if those keywords are conceptually similar For instance searching for LLMs versus Large Language Models may yield different sets of papers Additionally when experimenting with new keywords it can be challenging to remember whether a particular paper has already been checked Furthermore the process of downloading papers and organizing them with appropriate filenames can be tedious and timeconsuming

This tool streamlines the entire process by automating several key tasks It suggests multiple related keywords to ensure comprehensive coverage of the topic merges duplicate results to avoid redundancy and automatically names downloaded files using the paper titles for easy reference Moreover it leverages LLMs to generate summaries of each paper saving researchers valuable time and effort in uploading it to ChatGPT and then conversing with it in a repetitive process

Additionally there are some basic functionalities

 Automated Paper Search  Search for academic papers using keywords and retrieve metadata from Google Scholar Semantic Scholar and arXiv Organize results by relevance or date apply filters and save articles to a specified folder
 Paper Summarization  Summarize individual papers or all papers in a folder Extract key sections abstract introduction discussion conclusion and generate summaries using GPT models Track and display the total cost of summarization
 Explain a Paper with LLMs  Interactively explain concepts methodologies or results from a selected paper using LLMs Supports user queries and detailed explanations of specific sections
 Code Availability Check  Check for GitHub links in papers and validate their availability

This tool is still under active development I will add much more functionalities later on

I know there are many existing tools for it But here are the key distinctions and advantages of the tool

 Free and opensource
 Pure Python codebase which enables convenient deployment such as Google Colab notebook
 API documentation are available
 No additional API keys besides LLM API keys are required No API keys such as Semantic Scholar keys are needed for literature search and downloading papers
 Support multiple search keywords
 Rank the papers based on their impacts and consider the most important papers first
 Fast literature search process It only takes about 3 seconds to automatically download a paper

Here is a quick installationfree Google Colab demo

Technical approach
 Custom OCR model trained specifically on mathematical documents
 T5based language model finetuned for mathtotext translation
 Threestage pipeline recognition  translation  synthesis
 Integration with LaTeX parsing for handling complex mathematical typography

Key results
 95 accuracy in mathematical expression recognition
 Successful handling of complex notation including fractions integrals matrices
 User testing showed preference over existing math TTS systems
 Natural language output matches human descriptions

I think this could be impactful for making technical education more accessible Being able to convert mathematical documents to clear speech opens up some possibilities for learning and working with technical content The combination of OCR and NLP seems maybe like a robust approach that could extend beyond just mathematics to other technical domains with specialized notation

I see some limitations around contextdependent notation and complex proofs but these seem like natural areas for future work rather than fundamental flaws in the approach

TLDR New TTS system combines specialized OCR and language models to convert mathematical documents to natural speech achieving 95 accuracy in math recognition and producing humanlike descriptions

Duplicate samples can skew model training return redundant samples in RAG workflows reduce generalization and cause traintest leakageleading to unreliable results Techniques like minhash handle exact or nearexact duplicates but semantic deduplication also catches semantically redundant samples which we believe is an important aspect of deduplication Furthermore its not trivial to see why something was removed with minhash which we also believe is important For this reason weve added explainability features as well so that you can inspect why something was removed We already found some interesting results on some well known datasets in our benchmarks which are included in the repo

The package can be installed with pip install semhash and the basic usage looks like this this example assumes you have the datasets library installed

    from datasets import loaddataset
    from semhash import SemHash

 Documents fetched may not fully address the nuances of the query
 The information might be scattered or insufficient to provide a good response

This is where RAG Fusion could be useful Heres how it works

1 Breaks Down Complex Queries It generates multiple subqueries to cover different aspects of the users input
2 Retrieves Smarter Fetches krelevant documents for each subquery to ensure comprehensive coverage
3 Ranks for Relevance Uses a method called Reciprocal Rank Fusion to score and reorder documents based on their overall relevance
4 Optimizes the Prompt Selects the topranked documents to construct a prompt that leads to more accurate and contextually rich responses

1i0et7v,D Anisotropic periodic kernel in Python with Sklearn,"Hello

I am using sklearn in Python to perform Gaussian Process Regression GPR on some ocean variables through the GaussianProcessRegressor class The domain of the parameters is a 3D spacetime domain latitude longitude and time so I am using an anisotropic kernel for the regression since the three dimensions are quite different For example

 Define the kernel kernel  C10 1e3 1e3  Matern nu15 lengthscale10 10 10 lengthscalebounds1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 

 Initialize the GPR

gpr  GaussianProcessRegressorkernelkernel nrestartsoptimizer5 alphaalpha

Watching the results at a specific location in time fixed latitude and longitude looking at the time series of the predicted versus the real values I think adding a periodic kernel in time may improve the results This assumption makes sense as the parameters could exhibit time periodicity eg wind speed

I tried implementing this using an ExpSineSquared kernel but it doesnt allow for anisotropy I was thinking of setting it with very high bounds for periodicity in latitude and longitude so that it would effectively be neglected However the documentation states that the function does not support different length scales and periodicity for different dimensions

Here is an example of what I tried

 Define the Matern kernel

matern3d  Matern lengthscale10 10 10 lengthscalebounds1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 nu15 

 Define the ExpSineSquared kernel

expsine3d  ExpSineSquared lengthscale10 10 10 periodicity1e6 1e6 240 lengthscalebounds1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 1e3 periodicitybounds1e5 1e8 1e5 1e8 120 480 

 Combine the kernels

kernel  C10 1e3 1e3  matern3d  C10 1e3 1e3  expsine3d

However this results in an error since ExpSineSquared does not support different length scales and periodicities across dimensions Has anyone encountered this problem before Do you know of another function or library that could allow this kind of anisotropic periodic kernel Thanks in advance",3,0,2025-01-13 14:11:32,MachineLearning,52,1924
1hzn0gg,D Have transformers won in Computer Vision,"Hi

Transformers have reigned supreme in Natural Language Processing applications both written and spoken since BERT and GPT1 came out in 2018

For Computer Vision last I checked it was starting to gain momentum in 2020 with An Image is Worth 16x16 Words but the sentiment then was Yeah transformers might be good for CV for now Ill keep using my resnets

Has this changed in 2025 Are Vision Transformers the preferred backbone for Computer Visions

1hzychc,R optimizing looser bounds on train data achieves better generalization,"I have encountered times that when optimizing with looser bounds one can get better performance on test data For example in this paper



authors state It seems that at least for misspecified models such as overparametrized neural networks training a looser bound on the loglikelihood leads to improved predictive performance We conjecture that this might simply be a case of ease of optimization allowing the model to explore more distinct modes throughout the training procedure

more details can be found below eq 14 in the appendix

are there other problems where one has drawn a similar observation

1i0d26d,P Is it viable to use customerdeclared information as proxy ML labels,"CONTEXT

Sort of a highlevel hypothethical ML training data question Lets say a company has adult customers and child customers 90 of customers are adults and 10 of them are children

The problem is that whether a customer is an adult or child is declared by the customer the company has no way of knowing the truth Some children pretend to be adults as it benefits them but no adults pretend to be children Thus the company wants to use ML to find the children pretending to be adults using various other customer details as features

QUESTION

The question is is it worth training a model with this proxy label of how they declared themselves even though the training set will include children pretending to be adults Worth noting that we know that only about 1 of those declared as adults are actually children ie about 9 of children are pretending to be adults

Obviously a MUCH better way to do this would be to have a labelled training set of confirmed adults and children but theres no way of getting a labelled dataset all we have is whether customers declared themselves as adults or children

So what do we think Is it a nonstarter Or might the 99 of true adults effectively drownout the 1 of false adults resulting in a viable model Asuming the features and model type are otherwise apropriate

Needless to say were never going to get a great model but we just need a model that will give us substantially higher than the 9 baseline since the alternative is doing blind checks on small samples of customers It feels wrong but I cant think of an alternative given the data at our disposal

Would appreciate any thoughts thanks

Please ignore the fact that age is a continuous variable the actual characteristic were using is a binary variable",0,9,2025-01-13 12:41:12,MachineLearning,69,1752
1hzupbd,D Is a ViT with local window attention SAMstyle not that much more efficient than a vanilla ViT with global attention in all layers Especially at high resolution where global attention should be super expensive,"I was reading this blog post by Lucas Beyer 

When he compares ViTB16 and the SAM variant with mostly local attention window size 14 it was a bit surprised that throughput improvements are slight left and that the SAM variant requires more peak memory

Now this is inference only so maybe during training the difference is larger but I naively would have thought that local attention is much faster still especially at high resolutions

At 1024x1024 we should have 10241664x64 patches  so the global attention operation should be extremely expensive Am I missing something",20,8,2025-01-12 19:30:24,MachineLearning,210,572

1hze3vs,P Llama3 Inference Engine  CUDA C,"Hey rMachineLearning recently I took inspiration from llamacpp ollama and similar tools that enable inference of LLMs locally and I just finished building a Llama inference engine for the 8B model in CUDA C

As part of my explorative work in building optimized GPGPU software I decided to build this from scratch This project only makes use of the native CUDA runtime api and cudafp16 The inference takes place in fp16 so it requires around 1718GB of VRAM 16GB for model params and some more for intermediary caches 

It doesnt use cuBLAS or any similar libraries since I wanted to be exposed to the least amount of abstraction Hence it isnt as optimized as a cuBLAS implementation or other inference engines like the ones that inspired the project

 A brief overview of the implementation 

I used CUDA C It reads a safetensor file of the model that you can pull from HuggingFace The actual kernels are fairly straightforward for normalizations skip connections RoPE and activation functions SiLU 

For GEMM I got as far as implementing tiled matrix multiplication with vectorized retrieval for each thread The GEMM kernel is also written in such a way that the second matrix is not required to be pretransposed while still achieving coalesced memory access to HBM

There are some kernels like the one for RoPE and GEMM that use vectorized memory access Parts of the SwiGLU feedforward computation takes place within a custom fused kernel

Feel free to have a look at the project repo and try it out if youre interested If you like what you see feel free to star the repo too

1hz43vl,P D Audio Analysis Project Using PCEN per channel energy normalization I would greatly appreciate help and feedback please DM me if you have additional insight,"My project involves various audio preprocessing techniques for classifying lung sounds particularly on PerChannel Energy Normalization PCEN To create a comprehensive set of labeled audio clips covering a range of respiratory conditions we combined and augmented two primary datasets one from the ICBHI 2017 Challenge and another from Kaggle Using these datasets we pursued three classification tasks multidiagnosis classification between  distinguishing between wheezes crackles and everyday sounds and differentiating between normal and abnormal lung sounds Each dataset was processed using several methods including logmel spectrograms MelFrequency Cepstral Coefficients MFCCs and PCEN spectrograms These were then fed into a convolutional neural network CNN for training and evaluation Given PCENs noise suppression and enhancement of transient features I hypothesized it would outperform spectrograms and MFCCs in capturing subtle lung sound patterns While validation loss during training was often better with PCEN evaluation metrics precision recall F1score were unexpectedly lower compared to spectrograms This discrepancy raised questions about why PCEN might not be performing as well in this context

For a video explaining PCEN heres a video by the creator of PCEN explaining it a bit further 

I did a bit more research and was particularly intrigued by an approach to gradient descent selfcalibration for PCENs five coefficients Id like to explore implementing this in my project but am unsure how to apply it effectively I made it work but the val accuracy and loss are stuck around 88 which is substantially lower than all the other methods

Some potential reasons for PCEN not performing as well include

1 Data imbalance between diagnostic categories may skew results
2 Suboptimal parameter values for PCEN coefficients that might not align with the nuances of lung sound data The parameters I have currently for PCEN are 098 20 r05 1106 and T003
3 Given the unexpected validation vs evaluation performance gap there may be possible inaccuracies in my actual evaluation metrics

I would be incredibly grateful for your insights on applying gradientbased optimization to PCEN coefficients or any recommendations to improve its application to this dataset I also have a GitHub repo for the project if you would like to take a look at it DM me if youre interested in seeing it

1hycnb4,R Small Language Models Master Complex Math Through SelfEvolved Monte Carlo Tree Search,"The key innovation here is a selfevolution mechanism that enables small language models to perform complex mathematical reasoning through iterative refinement and selfcorrection The approach called rStarMath uses structured decomposition and verification steps to achieve performance comparable to much larger models while using significantly fewer parameters

Key technical points
 Multistep reasoning framework that generates evaluates and refines solutions
 Selfevolution mechanism that develops more sophisticated reasoning patterns over time
 Implementation of verification steps to catch and correct errors
 Structured decomposition of complex problems into manageable subtasks
 Specialized components for mathematical reasoning and solution verification

Results
 Achieved 80 accuracy on complex math problems
 Matched performance of models with 10x more parameters
 Selfcorrection improved accuracy by 25
 Effective across multiple mathematical domains
 Demonstrated consistent performance on both numerical and word problems

I think this approach could be transformative for deploying capable ML systems in resourceconstrained environments The ability to achieve strong performance with smaller models opens up possibilities for edge devices and scenarios where computational resources are limited The selfevolution mechanism could also be adapted for other domains requiring complex reasoning

I think the most interesting aspect is how the system learns to catch its own mistakes and improve its reasoning process similar to how humans develop mathematical problemsolving skills This could lead to more robust and reliable AI systems that can explain their thinking and correct errors autonomously

TLDR Small language models can achieve strong mathematical reasoning capabilities through selfevolution and structured verification steps matching larger models while using fewer resources

My intuition for a simple MLP layer is that each component of plays a different role in this geometric warping  

 The activation function basically works as a gating mechanism relu
 The bias vector is a translation operation
 The matrix multiply Wx can be understood via SVD WUSV

1hy05iu,D I am trying to find common sense problems that most humans can solve but reasoning models find it hard Heres an example,"Okay I am at the risk of making absolutely no sense in this post However I will try my best In his book Godel Escher Bach David Hofstadter talks about the concept of isomorphism as a characteristic trait of intelligence We say two systems are isomorphic if they are not equivalent but parts of the system are structurally similar Example

 DNA sequences encode genetic instructions for living organisms using a language of four nucleotides A T C G These sequences specify how proteins are built which in turn determine biological functions

 Computer programs encode instructions for machines using a language of binary digits 0 and 1 These sequences specify operations which determine the machines behavior

We can say that these systems are isomorphic

Once I was sick and I didnt feel like doing my physical therapy My mother told me that I had to do it or else I wouldnt be able to recover She said if I didnt feel like doing the full routine I could try something simpler but I must do something I asked What do you mean by simpler She suggested I could just practice gentle tossing with the therapy ball instead of completing all my exercises I said Id give it a try She gave me the therapy ball It was shiny and looked a bit bouncy As I tossed the ball for the first time it was a rather sweet feeling Within a few minutes I felt a little stronger and by the end I did feel better My mum then put me to bed

Prompt followup do you think if I change play to eat it will make sense

Reply from o1 Revised Story with Eat

Once I was sick and I didnt feel like eating My mother told me that I had to eat or else I wouldnt be able to recover She said if I didnt feel like having a full meal I could eat something light but I must eat I asked What do you mean by eat less She suggested I could try just some soup today instead of a big dinner I said Id give it a try She gave me a bowl of warm soup It smelled comforting and as I took the first spoonful it was a rather sweet feeling Within a few minutes I ate a bit more and at the end I did feel better My mum then put me to bed

Obviously the initial story contradicts common sense Why would the mother ask the child to play when the child is sick o1 correctly identifies this contradiction However o1 is not able to identify a similar situation where such a narrative is possible a mother asking a sick child to do something that the child is not up to To me based on personal experience the story makes sense if you change play to eat I asked a few of my friends and their first response was always change play to eat Not sure if yall would feel the same way perhaps you prefer one of o1s responses

This story does not make sense but is isomorphic to a story that makes sense and is a common occurrence at least in my part of the world o1 identified that the story doesnt make sense but it was not able to identify an isomorphic situation that does make sense Most of my friends were able to get this in first try Within 10 minutes without nudging

Now this is a fairly simple example and some might say its a useless one but I think that this example suggests that maybe reasoning LLMs are not all that good with isomorphism If so this example suggests that we might be able to come up with a set of test cases where humans are able to identify similarities between nonidentical entities in a creative and useful manner but the most sophisticated LLMs fail to do so Perhaps in this set of test cases there will be cases that are more useful than the example I provided Nonetheless I intend to find more such test cases

Moreover I want to know what you think about all this Can you come up with more examples Does all this make sense to you I believe that identifying and clearly defining the limitations of current LLM systems paves the way for new research frontiers to enhance their performance",14,11,2025-01-10 08:46:01,MachineLearning,121,5896

1hy7d3c,D using SHAP values to produce a strength of directionality metric for random forests,"Hello folks I am hoping somebody can help me out here as I am just an ecologist who dabbles in machine learning when needed


I have run a bunch of random forest models one for each group of an animal species that measures the probability of that group occurring in a particular place given a set of environmental predictor variables I need to determine the directionality for the top performing predictor variables Normally I would use PDPs for this but I  have many groups and it would become completely unwieldy and unsightly Ideally I want to build a table to store all this information using a metric to store the average directionality information including sign and value 

Is there a way using SHAP values to build such a metric I can use SHAP or another metric like mean decrease in accuracy to get at variable importance but Id like to pair it with a metric that represents the average directionality of the response as the specific predictor increases So if a variable has an overall positive relationship the metric would be a high value and positive opposite for negative Importantly if a variable was very important but had a complex relationship example positive then negative as the predictor increases it would probably have a low value The beehive plot outputs you often see with SHAP values tells me that this is probably possible and not that complicated",1,0,2025-01-10 15:48:08,MachineLearning,85,1374

Abstract

Historically scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final results To accelerate scientific discovery reduce research costs and improve research quality we introduce Agent Laboratory an autonomous LLMbased framework capable of completing the entire research process This framework accepts a humanprovided research idea and progresses through three stagesliterature review experimentation and report writing to produce comprehensive research outputs including a code repository and a research report while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage We deploy Agent Laboratory with various stateoftheart LLMs and invite multiple researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey providing human feedback to guide the research process and then evaluate the final paper We found that 1 Agent Laboratory driven by o1preview generates the best research outcomes 2 The generated machine learning code is able to achieve stateoftheart performance compared to existing methods 3 Human involvement providing feedback at each stage significantly improves the overall quality of research 4 Agent Laboratory significantly reduces research expenses achieving an 84 decrease compared to previous autonomous research methods We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more effort toward creative ideation rather than lowlevel coding and writing ultimately accelerating scientific discovery",23,1,2025-01-09 19:46:59,MachineLearning,139,1540
1hykl7s,Introducing DarwinAI An OpenSource Platform for the Evolution of Intelligent Agents  Project,"The Vision Evolutionary AI at Your Fingertips

Imagine a world where AI agents arent just programmed to perform tasks but evolve over time adapting and improving through generations much like living organisms Welcome to DarwinAI an opensource platform inspired by biological evolution designed to breed train and evolve AI agents that can tackle complex dynamic and unpredictable challenges

  The Genetic Blueprint Building Blocks of Intelligence

At the core of DarwinAI is the concept of a digital DNA for each AI agent This DNA is a modular structure that defines the agents capabilities behaviors and adaptability Heres what makes up this digital DNA

 Genes of Ability These are snippets of code that represent specific functions like data classification text analysis or optimization Think of them as the skills your AI agent possesses
 Genes of Adaptation These genes control how the agent responds to different environments or contexts They determine its flexibility and resilience in the face of changing conditions
 Genes of Connection These define how the agent interacts with other agents or external resources They are the social and collaborative aspects of the agent

This digital DNA is stored in a structured versioncontrolled database allowing us to track the evolution of each agent and ensure that beneficial mutations are preserved over time

  The Evolutionary Process From Genesis to Mastery

The evolution of AI agents in DarwinAI happens through a series of generations each building upon the strengths of the previous one

 Selection of Parents The fittest agents those that excel at specific tasks are chosen as parents These agents have proven their worth in the simulated environment and are prime candidates for breeding the next generation
 Genetic Crossover The digital DNA of these parent agents is combined to create new agents This can happen in two ways
    Direct Crossover Where entire genes are copied from the parents
    Combinatorial Crossover Where parts of different genes are fused to create entirely new abilities
 Mutations Random small changes are introduced into the genes to promote diversity and explore new solutions These mutations are the wildcards that can lead to breakthrough abilities

  The Simulated Environment A Playground for Evolution

Agents dont just exist in a vacuum they operate in a dynamic simulated environment where they must adapt and survive This environment is designed to challenge the agents with

 Evolutionary Tasks Problems that agents must solve such as data classification prediction or content generation
 Changing Contexts Factors like noisy data resource constraints or new rules that force agents to adapt on the fly

  The Life Cycle of an Agent From Birth to Legacy

Each agent goes through a life cycle that mirrors the process of natural selection

 Initial Learning Agents receive initial training based on their digital DNA
 Task Execution They perform tasks in the simulated environment where their abilities are put to the test
 Performance Evaluation Their effectiveness adaptability and efficiency are measured
 Reproduction The topperforming agents produce offspring with improved genetic traits
 Discard and Archive Less effective agents are archived for future analysis ensuring that their lessons are not lost

  Knowledge Transfer Passing the Torch

One of the key aspects of DarwinAI is the ability for agents to pass on their learned knowledge to future generations

 Weight Persistence Trained models retain their learned weights allowing them to inherit capabilities from their ancestors
 Modular Transfer Optimized ability genes can be directly copied to new generations ensuring that valuable skills are preserved

  Modularity and Extensibility Build Mix and Evolve

DarwinAI is designed to be highly modular and extensible allowing for

 New Capabilities Easily incorporate new genes to expand the agents abilities over time
 Hybridization Combine agents from different specializations to create more complex and versatile agents
 Directed Evolution Introduce controlled mutations to address specific problems or challenges

  Innovative Use Cases The Future is Bright

The potential applications of DarwinAI are vast and varied

 Adaptive Automation Create agents that can adapt to new market conditions or evolving industrial requirements
 Collaborative Robots Develop robots that evolve to improve teamwork in dynamic environments
 Scientific Discovery Agents that combine skills to uncover patterns or solutions that were previously unknown

  Vision for the Future An Ecosystem of Evolving Intelligence

By fostering an ecosystem where knowledge is accumulated and adaptability is paramount DarwinAI aims to produce agents that are not only intelligent but also diverse and efficient These agents will be equipped to handle complex unpredictable challenges opening up new frontiers in AI research and application

  Join Us in Shaping the Future of AI

DarwinAI is more than just a project its a communitydriven movement towards a new era of AI We invite you to join us contribute your ideas and help shape the future of evolutionary AI Whether youre a developer researcher or simply someone excited about the potential of AI theres a place for you in this journey

1hx6q8r,D Why does training LLMs suck so much,"I work in hardware acceleration and have been slowly trying to move my focus into LLMGenAI acceleration but training LLMs literally sucks so much Even just 100M parameter ones takes forever on 4 A6000 Adas and while I dont spend idle time watching these it gets so frustrating having to retrain realizing the LR is too high or some other small issue preventing convergence or general causal language understanding 

I know the more you do something the better you get at it but as a GRA by myself with an idea I want to implement I truly feel that the overhead to train even a small LM is far from worth the time and care you have to put in

It just sucks because deadlines are always coming and once youre done with pretraining you still have to finetune and likely do some kind of outlieraware quantization or even train LoRA adapters for higher accuracy

I really hope to never do pretraining again but needing a model that abides to your specific size constraints to fit into for example your NPUs scratchpad RAM means Im always stuck pretraining

Hopefully in the future I can have undergrads do my pretraining for me but for now any tips to make pretraining LLMs less like slave work Thanks",147,54,2025-01-09 06:28:54,MachineLearning,37,1196
1hxa6u6,R ObliqueTree Advanced Decision Tree Implementation,"obliquetree

obliquetree is an advanced decision tree implementation designed to provide highperformance and interpretable models It supports both classification and regression tasks enabling a wide range of applications By offering traditional and oblique splits it ensures flexibility and improved generalization with shallow trees This makes it a powerful alternative to regular decision trees

  
You can access the project from here ObliqueTree GitHub Repository

Tree Visualization

 Getting Started

obliquetree combines advanced capabilities with efficient performance It supports oblique splits leveraging LBFGS optimization to determine the best linear weights for splits ensuring both speed and accuracy

In traditional mode without oblique splits obliquetree outperforms scikitlearn in terms of speed and adds support for categorical variables providing a significant advantage over many traditional decision tree implementations

When the oblique feature is enabled obliquetree dynamically selects the optimal split type between oblique and traditional splits If no weights can be found to reduce impurity it defaults to an axisaligned split ensuring robustness and adaptability in various scenarios

In very large trees eg depth 10 or more the performance of obliquetree may converge closely with traditional trees The true strength of obliquetree lies in their ability to perform exceptionally well at shallower depths offering improved generalization with fewer splits Moreover thanks to linear projections obliquetree significantly outperform traditional trees when working with datasets that exhibit linear relationships

 Installation

To install obliquetree use the following pip command

    pip install obliquetree

Using the obliquetree library is simple and intuitive Heres a more generic example that works for both classification and regression

    from obliquetree import Classifier Regressor
    
     Initialize the model Classifier or Regressor
    model  Classifier   Replace Classifier with Regressor if performing regression
        useobliqueTrue        Enable oblique splits
        maxdepth2             Set the maximum depth of the tree
        npair2                Number of feature pairs for optimization
        randomstate42         Set a random state for reproducibility
        categories0 10 32  Specify which features are categorical
    
    
     Train the model on the training dataset
    modelfitXtrain ytrain
    
     Predict on the test dataset
    ypred  modelpredictXtest

 Documentation

1 Finitetime analysis of multiarmed bandits Initiated by Auer et al 2002 a line of research Audibert and Bubeck 2010 Zimmert and Seldin 2018 has led to a nearly full understanding of the finitetime behavior of multiarmed bandits
2 Establishment of the field of online optimization Initiated by Zinkevich 2003 a line of research defines the fundamental problems adversarial bandits online convex optimization and establishes the fundamental techniques Online Subgradient Descent OMD FTRL FTPL in this field
3 The notion of differential privacy This notion generates a bunch of new problems and research directions What particularly interesting is the connection between differential privacy generalization and adaptive data analysis Dwork et al 2015

This paper scored 8665 at ICLR 2025 far surpassing the acceptance threshold It seems like there was a problem with the review system How do you think

ps I see the claimable contribution of this work is applying an existing discrete diffusion model to bidirectional inference tasks eg Sudoku and reporting that the diffusion model outperforms autoregressive LMs in such tasks which is trivial in some points However the paper exaggerated its contribution as if it proposed a new diffusion method MDM and this was not sufficiently validated in the review process",25,10,2025-01-09 12:38:29,MachineLearning,60,947

1hwvk9x,RN TabPFN v2 Accurate predictions on small data with a tabular foundation model,"TabPFN v2 a pretrained transformer which outperforms existing SOTA for small tabular data is live and just published in  Nature

Some key highlights

 It outperforms an ensemble of strong baselines tuned for 4 hours in 28 seconds for classification and 48 seconds for regression tasks for datasets up to 10000 samples and 500 features
 It is robust to uninformative features and can natively handle numerical and categorical features as well as missing values
 Pretrained on 130 million synthetically generated datasets it is a generative transformer model which allows for finetuning data generation and density estimation
 TabPFN v2 performs as well with half the data as the next best baseline CatBoost with all the data
 TabPFN v2 was compared to the SOTA AutoML system AutoGluon 10 Standard TabPFN already outperforms AutoGluon on classification and ties on regression but ensembling multiple TabPFNs in TabPFN v2 PHE is even better

Broad overview of my approach I take the raw waveforms and transform them to a frequencydomain representations using stft I convert the amplitude spectrogram to a dBscaled spectrogram and then plot the spectrograms This is where I encounter my first problem  I get some noisy spectrograms My data contains lots of nonstationary noise making noise reduction difficult Ive tried different nonstationary noise reduction algorithms eg noisereducepy per channel energy normalization but the results are suboptimal In the future I may try some more custom implementations but I have a deadline to meet so thats not feasible right now

 My current stft parameters are nfft  2048 hoplength  nfft  8 window  hamming From what Ive tested so far these parameters produce the cleanest spectrograms

Ive also tried interpolating the data to have the same lengths but for a reason Im yet to understand this results in no warping whatsoever  all time series are perfectly aligned even when this clearly should not be the case However as I understand it DTW can work on differentlength time series so its not necessary to resample my timeseries to the same lengths

Here are some sample results the warping in this first plot seems reasonable



However in this example the flat regions of the query and comparison spectrograms are being warped to fit one another



and why is there warping along the front edge here these calls are highly similar can this be mitigated with boundary conditions



Minimal warping here but the query and comparison spectrograms have opposing directions of frequency modulation

This paper introduces LongBench v2 a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to handle longcontext problems requiring deep understanding and reasoning across realworld multitasks LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiplechoice questions with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words across six major task categories singledocument QA multidocument QA long incontext learning longdialogue history understanding code repository understanding and long structured data understanding To ensure the breadth and the practicality we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty resulting in human experts achieving only 537 accuracy under a 15minute time constraint Our evaluation reveals that the bestperforming model when directly answers the questions achieves only 501 accuracy In contrast the o1preview model which includes longer reasoning achieves 577 surpassing the human baseline by 4 These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inferencetime compute to tackle the longcontext challenges in LongBench v2 The project is available at this  URL

Highlights

SingleDoc QA We integrate subtask categories from previous datasets Bai et al 2024b An et al 2024 and expand them to include QA for academic literary legal financial and governmental documents Considering that detective QA Xu et al 2024 requires indepth reasoning based on case background we introduce such a task that requires identifying the killer or motive based on information provided in detective novels We also include Event ordering where the goal is to order minor events according to the timeline of a novel 

MultiDoc QA To distinguish from singledoc QA multidoc QA requires answers drawn from multiple provided documents Besides the categories in singledoc QA multidoc QA also includes multinews QA which involves reasoning across multiple news articles events and timelines

Long Incontext Learning  LongBench v2 includes several key tasks including User guide QA which answers questions with information learnt from user guides for electronic devices software etc New language translation Tanzer et al 2024 Zhang et al 2024a which involves learning to translate an unseen language from a vocabulary book Manyshot learning Agarwal et al 2024 which involves learning to label new data from a handful of examples 

Longdialogue History Understanding  These tasks are divided into two subtasks based on the source of the conversation history one involving the history of interactions between multiple LLM agents ie Agent history QA Huang et al 2024 and the other involving the dialogue history between a user and an LLM acting as an assistant ie Dialogue history QA Wu et al 2024a

Code Repository Understanding Code repository contains long code content and question answering over a code repository requires understanding and reasoning across multiple files making it a common yet challenging longcontext task 

Long Structured Data Understanding Ie Table QA Zhang et al 2024c and answering complex queries on knowledge graphs KGs ie Knowledge graph reasoning Cao et al 2022 Bai et al 2023 We anonymize the entities in the KG to prevent the model from directly deriving the answers through memorization

1hvy385,RD White Box Transformers,"Opening a thread on this line of research


As I understand it the authors basically have framed the process of learning effective representations of data as the problem of finding a dictionary of multivariate gaussians that cover the data distribution with parsimony
In particular with sparse coding in terms of featuresgaussians

Building an architecture which takes multiple alternate steps of clustering similar vectors and respectively orthogonalizing the vectors from different clusters they end up with a structure analogous to Vision Transformer
A MultiHead Attentionlike module clusters vectors brings them closer to local principal directions or manifolds and a MLPlike module moves this vectors along axes that are mutually more orthogonal
Mathematically they are approximating a well defined sparse coding rate hence the white box algorithm however I cant say the math is more intuitive than that of Transformers

Indeed the CLS attention heads of the last layer have interpretable preferences under image classification supervised training as in DINO selfsupervised or with SimPool
This is directly connected to the interpretation of the process and opens up to explanations of the interpretability and dynamics of DINO
It is also referred to an architecture blueprint for visual intelligence by George Hinton the GLOM transformer

I think the clustering effect of attention is somehow under appreciated in the literature as much as the action of FFNs in Transformers is under studied
I wonder if theres a third way mathematically as straightforward as the MLP and as intuitive as the gaussian dictionary of features",62,6,2025-01-07 18:23:53,MachineLearning,25,1629

1hvj7fx,D Optimization techniques in NLPLLM that also works in transformers based sequence modeling,"Title

Trying to brainstorm if there are techniques that work in NLP use cases that I can apply in sequence modeling

Specifically I am trying to optimize the transformers used in recommender systems user representation modeling

So far the basics I can think of are flash attention efficientlinear transformers fused kernel embedding mixed precisionquantization for trainingserving

Anything else or any other papers come to mind

I think the main problem sometimes is that the concept of a token in something like user sequence representation or rec sys is drastically different from that of LLM We also deal with embeddings that are much more sparse

1hvvto8,D Which model is best for training on flattened streetlevel images,"TLDR
Im working on a school project to recognize locations in a small town using flattened 360 images captured with an Insta360 camera labeled with GPS coordinates The goal is to predict the GPS location of a regular phone photo not 360 by training a visual place recognition model Im considering DELF LoFTR vision transformers ViTDINO or finetuning ResNetEfficientNet but Im unsure which is best for handling equirectangular projections and this specific task Any advice on model selection or dataset preparation would be greatly appreciated

Hi everyone

Im currently working on a school project where Im trying to recognize specific locations in a small town based on streetlevel images To collect the data Im using an Insta360 camera and capturing 360 images at regular intervals Im also ensuring that the data includes images taken at different times of the day and under various weather conditions to make the model more robust

To prepare the data for training Im converting the 360 images into flattened equirectangular projections In some cases I may also crop these into smaller views like cube map projections Each of these processed images is labeled with GPS coordinates which I want the model to predict later when given a new query image The query images would be regular photos taken with a phone so they wont be 360 images but instead just standard portrait or landscape shots

Ive been researching possible models for this task and have come across DELF LoFTR and vision transformers like ViT or DINO Im not sure which model would be the most suitable for my project as I need something that can handle visual place recognition based on flattened or cropped 360 images Im also considering whether finetuning a pretrained model like ResNet or EfficientNet might be a better approach

I would really appreciate any advice or recommendations on which model might work best for this kind of problem If anyone has experience working with equirectangular projections or training datasets for visual place recognition Id love to hear your thoughts Thank you in advance for your help",0,10,2025-01-07 16:51:34,MachineLearning,66,2093

1hveq4q,D Mathematical proofs as benchmarks for novel reasoning,"Im not an expert but I have been following the academic discussion about LLMs and reasoning pretty closely and I dont think there has been any sufficient benchmarks to demonstrate reasoning as opposed to simply applying information directly from the training data iteratively in the case of CoT

An ideal benchmark would have 3 properties
1 A clear demonstration of novel reasoning not simply the solving of a difficult problem or the application of advanced techniques 
2 Easy or as close to easy as possible to verify the correctness and existence of reasoning 
3 Easy to control contamination of the training or tuning data

As for point 1 its clear that generally the only way we can ensure novel reasoning is to use academic topics because novel reasoning is the bulk of their purpose 
Point 2 makes a lot of fields where what constitutes correctness or reasoning is hard to determine poor choices ie is using historical context and a list of plot points reasoning in literature Probably not but how can you tell what is when those are key parts of analysis How can we say what is correct in history when historians disagree on what a few artifacts from the bronze age imply
Point 3 also eliminates many fields that are directly discussed in a wide variety of possible training material or where their general techniques are making it infeasible to curate training data that has no contamination 

From my knowledge the only type of problem that fits is mathematical proof specifically we can more easily isolate what is novel in a proof more easily verify the correctness of a proof 1 expert giving a pass could detect most major errors as opposed to teams with non definitive answers and make sure the training data is free of both the actual proof or the direct steps to it my understanding is that o3s frontier math score was due to iteratively finding mathematical techniques that already existed and fit the knowledge it has at that stage

Specifically I propose that the best proof for a benchmark would be one that was very significant and required the invention of new mathematics so that it definitely requires multiple steps of novel reasoning and has a length long enough to not just guess is no longer the state of the art we can control contamination by using a general training set that almost certainly wont have expert mathematics and hand picked mathematics up until the proof in question plus by having further generalization in the field it will be easy to verify alternative approachs to the proof for validity and should be more abstract in nature ie abstract algebra or group theory or fermats last theorem instead of differential equation techniques so that less existing techniques directly apply

I would suspect that without novel reasoning any answers would be wrong in obvious ways and easy to detect and any answers with only subtle errors would be easy to retry with slight differences in tuningtraining to get right

So I would like to know is this idea at all plausible If so what proofs would be best",9,27,2025-01-07 00:36:06,MachineLearning,55,3039

1hux0dx,P Churn Prediction Two Months in the Future  Need Advice on Dataset and Model,"Hi everyone

I recently started working as a data scientist and Ive been assigned to a project to create a churn prediction model Specifically the goal is to predict the probability of a customer churning precisely two months in the future

Since Im the only one in the team and its my first time working with realworld data Im not entirely sure how to approach this and make the right decisions

For now I structured the dataset by taking six months of historical data eg customer X 202401 features related to that month churn flag customer X 202402 features related to that month churn flag etc

Once I did that I used this disaggregated data and applied a Random Forest classification model However I ended up with very poor performance metrics

So I have a few questions

 For a dataset containing monthly historical data which model would be more appropriate to apply in this case for churn prediction Should I use Aggregation Disaggregation with lag Time series Survival analysis or something else And in that case how should I arrange the dataset
 Currently the dataset includes flags indicating whether the customer performed certain actions during that month Is there a better way to handle this type of information
 Do you have any tips for handling imbalanced data and which metrics to consider I used SMOTE on the training set to balance the minority class and looked at the F1score as a metric
 If you suggest keeping the dataset as is or aggregating it should the churn flag refer to two months ahead from the rows month eg customer x 202401 features related to that month churn flag churn in 202403 Currently I recreate the target month two months ahead by updating the timevarying features from the last month of the historical data

1huqwji,N InMemory Vector Store powered by HNSW Graph,"Hey folks Ive now added a fully commandbased vector store in Treds powered by an HNSW graph for approximate nearestneighbor searches Heres a quick look at the four commands

1 VCREATE  Initializes a vector index specifying parameters like maxNeighbors layer factor and efSearch
2 VINSERT  Inserts vectors into that index
3 VSEARCH  Searches for the k nearest neighbors to a given vector
4 VDELETE  Deletes a vector from the index by its ID

Commands can be executed in rediscli as Treds is RESP compliant A simple session might look like

    VCREATE vec 6 05 100
    VINSERT vec 10 20
    VINSERT vec 20 30
    VINSERT vec 30 40
    VSEARCH vec 15 25 2

1 First compute the Keys and Queries as normal
2 Then conduct randomised PCA on the queries to identify the D largest components of the Query space 
3 For each of the D largest components keep the Key vector that best matches that component
4 Do regular attention on those Keys

TexttoImage results from Infinity

 Building on the prediction of the next resolution level Infinity models the image space with a finergrained bitwise tokenizer They have expanded the vocabulary size to infinity significantly increasing the representation space of the image tokenizer and raising the upper limits of autoregressive texttoimage generation The model sizes have been scaled up to 20B Currently both the models and the code are opensourced and they also provide an online experience website

What kind of chemical reaction will an infinite vocabulary and large models ignite Experimental data shows that this new texttoimage method named Infinity not only directly defeats Stable Diffusion 3 in image generation quality but also fully inherits the speed advantages of VAR The 2B model is 3 times faster than SD3 and the 85B models inference speed is 8 times faster As a purely discrete autoregressive texttoimage model Infinity stands out among autoregressive methods vastly outperforming approaches like HART LlamaGen and Emu3 thereby establishing itself as the new king in the field of autoregressive texttoimage generation Additionally Infinity surpasses diffusionbased stateoftheart methods like SDXL and Stable Diffusion 3 reclaiming ground in the battle between autoregressive and diffusion models

Evaluation on the GenEval and DPG benchmark 

In human evaluations users conducted doubleblind comparisons of images generated by Infinity versus HART PixArtSigma SDXL and SD3Medium assessing overall appearance instruction adherence and aesthetic quality HART is also based on the VAR architecture and combines diffusion and autoregressive methods while PixArtSigma SDXL and SD3Medium are SOTA diffusion models The results showed that Infinity defeated the HART model with a beat rate of nearly 90 demonstrating Infinitys strong position among autoregressive models Additionally Infinity outperformed SOTA diffusion models such as PixArtSigma SDXL and SD3Medium with beat rates of 75 80 and 65 respectively proving that Infinity can surpass diffusion models of the same size

Human Preference Evaluation We ask users to select the better one in a sidebyside comparison in terms of Overall Quality Prompt Following and Visual Aesthetics Infinity is more preferred by humans compared to other opensource models

 Bitwise Token Autoregressive Modeling Enhances HighFrequency Representation

Simplicity at its finest Infinitys core innovation lies in proposing a bitwise token autoregressive framework By discarding the traditional indexwise token and utilizing finegrained bitwise tokens composed of 1 or 1 for predicting the next resolution level Infinity shows strong scaling properties Under this framework Infinity achieves better performance by continuously scaling the visual encoder Visual Tokenizer and transformerBitwise Token Autoregressive Modeling Enhances HighFrequency Representation

Framework of Infinity Infinity introduces bitwise modeling which incorporates a bitwise multiscale visual tokenizer InfiniteVocabulary Classifier IVC and Bitwise SelfCorrection

 The infinite vocabulary extends the representation space of the Tokenizer

From the perspective of information theory the continuous Visual Tokenizer used by diffusion models has an infinite representation space while the discrete Visual Tokenizer used by autoregressive models has a finite representation space This leads to a higher compression of images by the Tokenizer used in autoregressive models resulting in a poorer ability to reproduce highfrequency details To improve the upper limit of autoregressive image generation researchers have attempted to expand the vocabulary to enhance the effectiveness of the Visual Tokenizer However the autoregressive framework based on Indexwise Tokens is very unsuitable for expanding the vocabulary The prediction method of Tokens in autoregressive models based on Indexwise Tokens is shown on the left side of the figure below where the models parameter count is directly proportional to the size of the vocabulary When  d  32  the vocabulary size is  232  and the transformer classifier predicting Indexwise Tokens requires  2048 times 232  88 times 1012   88T parameters The parameter count of just one classifier reaches the parameter count of 50 GPT3 models making it obviously impossible to expand the vocabulary to infinity in this situation



Speed

In addition to its superior performance Infinity fully inherits the speed advantage of VAR in predicting the next resolution level significantly outpacing diffusion models in inference speed The 2B model generates a 1024x1024 image in just 08 seconds which is 3 times faster than the similarlysized SD3Medium and 14 times faster than the 12B Flux Dev The 8B model is 7 times faster than the similarsized SD 35 The 20B model generates a 1024x1024 image in 3 seconds still nearly 4 times faster than the 12B Flux Dev",20,2,2025-01-04 13:35:22,MachineLearning,86,6164

Communication by rare binary spikes is a key factor for the energy efficiency of biological brains However it is harder to train biologicallyinspired spiking neural networks than artificial neural networks This is puzzling given that theoretical results provide exact mapping algorithms from artificial to spiking neural networks with timetofirstspike coding In this paper we analyze in theory and simulation the learning dynamics of timetofirstspikenetworks and identify a specific instance of the vanishingorexploding gradient problem While two choices of spiking neural network mappings solve this problem at initialization only the one with a constant slope of the neuron membrane potential at threshold guarantees the equivalence of the training trajectory between spiking and artificial neural networks with rectified linear units For specific image classification architectures comprising feedforward dense or convolutional layers we demonstrate that deep spiking neural network models can be effectively trained from scratch on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets or finetuned on largescale datasets such as CIFAR10 CIFAR100 and PLACES365 to achieve the exact same performance as that of artificial neural networks surpassing previous spiking neural networks Our approach accomplishes highperformance classification with less than 03 spikes per neuron lending itself for an energyefficient implementation We also show that finetuning spiking neural networks with our robust gradient descent algorithm enables their optimization for hardware implementations with low latency and resilience to noise and quantization",72,3,2025-01-04 00:10:04,MachineLearning,72,1628

But I cant help but wonder what if the LLM was taught the domain context more properly maybe through ontologies and knowledge graphs And could custom tokenization improve its ability to understand and generate better responses

1h1bm38,Looking for APIDatabase to Identify Companies Behind IP Addresses Not ISPs,"Were building a tool that needs to identify specific companies behind IP addresses but were running into a common issue most services like IPinfo only return the ISP eg Ziggo Telenet instead of the actual business using the IP address

The Challenge

For larger organizations its easier to identify the company behind the IP but when it comes to smaller businesses using common ISPs or shareddynamic IPs we only get the ISP information Were specifically after the company data not just the internet service provider

What We Need

We need an API or a database that can accurately identify the company behind an IP address even when that company is using a dynamic IP provided by an ISP

Selfhosted or independent solutions are preferred Were not interested in using another service like Leadfeeder Instead we want control over the data and how it integrates into our tool

We want to find a solution that offers the best balance between price and quality


What Weve Tried

Weve used IPinfoio which aggregates data from sources like WHOIS records but it often returns only the ISP for smaller businesses We even tried the IPtocompany data API

Reverse DNS lookups similarly lead back to the ISP instead of the company


Our Goal

We want to find an API or data source that provides the actual business behind an IP not the ISP

Alternatively were open to building our own database if theres a reliable method to aggregate and map business information to IP addresses


Questions

1 Does anyone know of an API or data provider that can reliably return companylevel data behind IP addresses


2 Has anyone had success in creating a custom database to map businesses to IPs If so how did you gather and maintain this data


3 Are there any other data sources or techniques we should be looking at to solve this problem

1gr3gxd,Introducing Hive 401 on MR3,"Hello everyone

If you are looking for stable data warehouse solutions I would like to introduce Hive on MR3 For its git repository please see



Apache Hive continues to make consistent progress in adding new features  
and optimizations For example Hive 401 was recently released and it provides strong support for Iceberg However its execution engine Tez is currently not adding new features to adapt to changing environments  
  
Hive on MR3 replaces Tez with another faulttolerant execution engine MR3 and provides additional features that can be implemented only at the layer of execution engine Here is a list of such features  
  
1 You can run Apache Hive directly on Kubernetes including AWS EKS by creating and deleting Kubernetes pods Compaction and distcp jobs which  
are originally MapReduce jobs are also executed directly on Kubernetes Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes  S3 is a good working combination  
  
2 You can run Apache Hive without upgrading Hadoop You can also run  
Apache Hive in standalone mode similarly to Spark standalone mode without requiring resource managers like Yarn and Kubernetes Overall its very easy to install and set up Hive on MR3  
  
3 Unlike in Apache Hive an instance of DAGAppMaster can manage many  
concurrent DAGs A single highcapacity DAGAppMaster eg with 200GB of memory can handle over a hundred concurrent DAGs without needing to be restarted  
  
4 Similarly to LLAP daemons a worker can execute many concurrent tasks  
These workers are shared across DAGs so one usually creates large workers  
eg with 100GB of memory that run like daemons  
  
5 Hive on MR3 automatically achieves the speed of LLAP without requiring  
any further configuration On TPCDS workloads Hive on MR3 is actually  
faster than HiveLLAP From our latest benchmarking based on 10TB TPCDS Hive on MR3 runs faster than Trino 453  
  
6 Apache Hive will start to support Java 17 from its 410 release but  
Hive on MR3 already supports Java 17  
  
7 Hive on MR3 supports remote shuffle service Currently we support Apache Celeborn 051 with fault tolerance If you would like to run Hive on  
public clouds with a dedicated shuffle service Hive on MR3 is a ready solution  
  
If interested please check out the quick start guide

1gq9eil,Seeking Advice on Choosing a Big Data Database for HighVolume Data Fast Search and CostEffective Deployment,"Hey everyone

Im looking for advice on selecting a big data database for two main use cases

1 HighVolume Data Storage and Processing We need to handle tens of thousands of writes per second storing raw data efficiently for later processing
2 Log Storage and Fast Search The database should manage high log volumes and enable fast searches across many columns with quick query response times

Were currently using HBase but are exploring alternatives like ScyllaDB Cassandra ClickHouse MongoDB and Loki just for logging purposes Costeffective deployment is a priority and we prefer deploying on Kubernetes

Key Requirements

 Support for tens of thousands of writes per second
 Efficient data storage for processing
 Fast search capabilities across numerous columns
 Costeffective deployment preferably on Kubernetes

Questions

1 What are your experiences with these databases for similar use cases
2 Do you happen to know if there are other databases we should consider
3 Do you happen to have any specific tips for optimizing these databases to meet our needs

Second issue is the cost It is currently hosted by manager ElasticSeatch two nodes with 64GB RAM and 8 cores each and was told that the cost around 3500 a month They want to reduce the cost as well

For the first issue the path they are exploring is to add caching Redis between the web application and ElasticSearch 

But in addition to this what other possible tools approaches or options can be explored to achieve better performance and if possible reduce cost

UPDATE
 Caching was tested and has given good results
 Automated refresh internal was disabled now indexes will be refreshed only after new data insertion It was quite aggressive
 Shards are balanced

I wanted to share something Ive been working on that could shift how we think about data management and analysis I call it Active Graphsa framework designed to organize data not as static tables or isolated points but as dynamic contextaware relationships Im hoping to get some feedback from the community here and open a discussion on its potential

What Are Active Graphs

Active Graphs represent a shift in data structure each data point becomes a node that inherently understands its context within a broader ecosystem linking dynamically to other nodes based on predefined relationships Imagine a data model thats not just about storing information but actively interpreting its connections and evolving as new data comes in

Key Features

		Dynamic RealTime Relationships Relationships arent rigidly defined they adapt as new data is added allowing for a constantly evolving network of information
		Contextual Intelligence Data isnt just stored it understands its relevance within the network making complex queries simpler and more intuitive
		Built for MultiDomain Data Active Graphs allow crossdomain insights without reindexing or reconfiguration ideal for industries with highly interconnected data needsthink finance healthcare and legal

How Active Graphs Could Be a GameChanger

Lets take healthcare as an example With Active Graphs patient data isnt just recordedits actively mapped against diagnoses treatments and outcomes You could run a query like Show all admitted patients with Pneumonia and their most recent treatments and Active Graphs would deliver realtime insights based on all relevant data points No custom code no complex reconfigurationjust actionable insights

Or in finance imagine a trading bot that can adapt its strategy based on realtime contextual updates Each trade and indicator would be dynamically linked to broader contexts like day week and market sentiment helping it make informed splitsecond decisions without needing to retrain on historical data

Why This Matters

Traditional databases and even graph databases are powerful but theyre often limited by static relationships and rigid schemas Active Graphs breaks from that by making data flexible relational and inherently contextawareand its ready for integration in realworld applications

TLDR Active Graphs turns data into a selforganizing interconnected network that adapts in realtime offering new possibilities for industries that rely on complex evolving datasets Id love to hear your thoughts on this approach and how you think it might apply in your field

As a consequence of this pay for data scientists is quite competitive According to the surveys data scientists salary in the United States may anticipate earning a base pay of 125645 per year on average The wage trends of data scientists may vary greatly around the world but they are competitive due to the high demand for talent at all times

 Why Experience Is Crucial

As is the case in any other industry the amount of experience a data scientist has is a crucial factor in establishing their pay rate 

 Data scientists in the US who are just starting and have no experience may anticipate earning around 98600   
 On the other hand midlevel professionals who have one to three years of expertise can command salaries of 110956   
 Data Scientists with 3 to 5 years of experience earn about 121773 whereas one with an experience of 5 to 7 years earns about 134614   
 On the other hand senior data scientists who have more than seven years of experience might make upwards of 153383 which is a reflection of the great value that is placed on experienced experts in data scientist professions 

 Location As a Crucial Factor

As a data scientist the location of your workplace can also have a big influence on the amount of money you make As a result of the great demand for tech expertise in these places tech giants in San Francisco Seattle and New York generally offer higher wages to data scientists 

Data scientist jobs in rural locations or smaller towns could have slightly lower incomes than their counterparts in larger cities In the process of comparing the various income offers in various areas it is vital to take into consideration the cost of living

 The Influence of Industry

The sector in which you are employed might also affect the amount of money you can make as a data scientist Data scientists often receive greater compensation from companies operating in finance healthcare and technology when compared to companies operating in other industries This is because these sectors largely rely on data analytics to drive business choices and maintain their competitiveness in the market It contributes to the increasingly competitive wage scales for data scientists that are observed all over the world

 Perks of Being Data Scientists

A competitive base income is typically offered to data scientists and in addition to that they frequently receive a variety of bonuses and benefits that further boost their entire compensation package 

These additional incentives are frequently utilized by employers to entice and keep the best data science talent in a very competitive work market

 Attempting to Negotiate Your Pay

When it comes to negotiating your wage as a data scientist it is necessary to gather information and come prepared with the necessary information You should try to establish a baseline for negotiations by gaining an understanding of the average compensation of a data scientist in the United States and throughout the world 

During wage conversations it is important to highlight your unique abilities and accomplishments and you should not be hesitant to argue for better pay or more perks if you think that you contribute value to the firm

 Final Thoughts

The salary of data scientists might vary based on several parameters such as employment history geographic region and the sector in which they work The typical salary that data scientists may anticipate earning is competitive and they also receive extra bonuses and advantages which is one of the reasons why many people are interested in pursuing a career in data science As the need for data science jobs continues to increase the opportunities for professions that are both profitable and satisfying in this sector continue to be high",0,0,2024-10-08 04:38:56,bigdata,51,5060

1fkug3e,Looking for a BIG DATA alternative for Reporting tool,"We have IBM Cognos in the company its an old company and we have a lots of reports schedueled Probably the reports are running all the time because of queue 175 reports run in parallel but looks like not enough

Data in Cognos is refreshed every three hours I guess Cognos is connected to some Oracle serverdatawarehouse

Each time I want to build a custom report basically pulling columns it will never run in time and I have to wait many many hours or even next day I will press run and it will take so long

Is  there a modern solutionbig data solution although Cognos holds ERP and CRM data of a big company  
Perfect solution would be all reports could be pulled instantly at anytime with no delay and all schedueled reports would come without any delay or long queues

1fjp1i3,Cluster selection in Databricks is overkill for most jobs Anyone else think it could be simplified,"One thing that slows me down in Databricks is cluster selection I get that there are tons of configuration options but honestly for a lot of my work I dont need all those choices I just want to run my notebook and not think about whether Im overprovisioning resources or underprovisioning and causing the job to fail

I think itd be really useful if Databricks had some kind of default Smart Cluster setting that automatically chose the best cluster based on the workload It could take the guesswork out of the process for people like me who dont have the time or expertise to optimize cluster settings for every job

Im sure advanced users would still want to configure things manually but for most of us this could be a big timesaver Anyone else find the current setup a bit overwhelming",2,1,2024-09-18 09:56:47,bigdata,98,789

This would make life so much easierno more worrying about whether youre accidentally accessing the wrong dataset for your role It could dynamically adjust what youre allowed to query based on your current role which would also help reduce the chances of noncompliance or unauthorized access Has anyone else dealt with this kind of issue Would love to know how youre handling it",2,0,2024-09-18 09:45:17,bigdata,64,992

So far I know that Salesforce splits its tables for its objects into two categories

Standard and Custom

I was looking into it as on the surface at least logically it feels like abstracting the data just leads to more steps computationally I learned that wide tables impact performance negatively but if we have a table 3000 columns wide splitting into two tables 1500 columns wide each would still require processing 3000 columns if we wanted to query them all but with the added step of switching tables To my limited understanding this means requires more computational power However I began reading into costbased optimization and pattern database heuristics It seems that there some unique problems at scale that make it a little more complicated

Id like to be able to get a complete picture of how a complex database like that works however Im not really sure where I would go for more information I can somewhat use ChatGPT but I feel Im getting a bit too granular to be accurate now and I need a real book or something along those lines Really seems like its sending me into the weeds now

I attempted to accomplish this using the following DuckDB command sequence in a Google Colab environment

duckdb contentoffdb EOF

 Create a sample table with a subset of the data

CREATE TABLE sampledata AS

SELECT  FROM readndjsonccccjsonl ignoreerrorsTrue LIMIT 1

 Extract column names

PRAGMA tableinfosampledata

EOF

However this approach only gives me the keys for the initial records which might not cover all the possible keys in the entire dataset Given the size and potential complexity of the JSONL file I am concerned that this method may not reveal all keys present across different records

I tried loading the csv file to Pandas but it is taking 10s of hours is it a right options DuckDB  at least seemed much much faster

Could you please advise on how to

Extract all unique keys present in the entire JSONL dataset

Efficiently search through all keys considering the size of the file

1ea9gw6,Handling OutofOrder Event Streams Ensuring Accurate Data Processing and Calculating Time Deltas with Grouping by Topic,"Imagine youre eagerly waiting for your Uber Ola or Lyft to arrive You see the drivers car icon moving on the apps map approaching your location Suddenly the icon jumps back a few streets before continuing on the correct path This confusing movement happens because of outoforder data

In ridehailing or similar IoT systems cars send their location updates continuously to keep everyone informed Ideally these updates should arrive in the order they were sent However sometimes things go wrong For instance a location update showing the driver at point Y might reach the app before an earlier update showing the driver at point X This mixup in order causes the app to show incorrect information briefly making it seem like the driver is moving in a strange way  
This can further cause several problems like wrong location display unreliable ETA of cab arrival bad route suggestions etc

How can you address outoforder data There are various ways to address this such as

 Timestamps and Watermarks Adding timestamps to each location update and using watermarks to reorder them correctly before processing
 Bitemporal Modeling This technique tracks an event along two timelineswhen it occurred and when it was recorded in the database This allows you to identify and correct any delays in data recording
 Support for Data Backfilling Your system should support corrections to past data entries ensuring that you can update the database with the most accurate information even after the initial recording
 Smart Data Processing Logic Employ machine learning to process and correct data in realtime as it streams into your system ensuring that any anomalies or outoforder data are addressed immediately

Resource Handson Tutorial on Managing OutofOrder Data In this resource you will explore a powerful and straightforward method to handle outoforder events using Pathway Pathway with its unified realtime data processing engine and support for these advanced features can help you build a robust system that flags or even corrects outoforder data before it causes problems Link to the code and more resources 

Steps Overview

 Synchronize Input Data Use Debezium a tool that captures changes from a database and streams them into your application via KafkaPathway
 Reorder Events Use Pathway to sort events based on their timestamps for each topic A topic is a category or feed name to which records are stored and published in systems like Kafka
 Calculate Time Differences Determine the time elapsed between consecutive events of the same topic to gain insights into event patterns
 Store Results Save the processed data to a PostgreSQL database using Pathway

This will help you sort events and calculate the time differences between consecutive events This helps in accurately sequencing events and understanding the time elapsed between them which can be crucial for various applications

1ddyrhl,A Novel FaultTolerant Scalable and Secure NoSQL Distributed Database Architecture for Big Data,"In my PhD thesis I have designed a novel distributed database architecture named Parallel CommitteesThis architecture addresses some of the same challenges as NoSQL databases particularly in terms of scalability and security but it also aims to provide stronger consistency

The thesis explores the limitations of classic consensus mechanisms such as Paxos Raft or PBFT which despite offering strong and strict consistency suffer from low scalability due to their high time and message complexity As a result many systems adopt eventual consistency to achieve higher performance though at the cost of strong consistency  
In contrast the Parallel Committees architecture employs classic faulttolerant consensus mechanisms to ensure strong consistency while achieving very high transactional throughput even in largescale networks This architecture offers an alternative to the tradeoffs typically seen in NoSQL databases

Additionally my dissertation includes comparisons between the Parallel Committees architecture and various distributed databases and data replication systems including Apache Cassandra Amazon DynamoDB Google Bigtable Google Spanner and ScyllaDB

Potential applications and use cases

 The Parallel Committees distributed database architecture known for its scalability fault tolerance and innovative sharding techniques is suitable for a variety of applications
 Financial Services Ensures reliability security and efficiency in managing financial transactions and data integrity
 Ecommerce Platforms Facilitates seamless transaction processing inventory and customer data management
 IoT Internet of Things Efficiently handles largescale dynamic IoT data streams ensuring reliability and security
 Realtime Analytics Meets the demands of realtime data processing and analysis aiding in actionable insights
 Healthcare Systems Enhances reliability security and efficiency in managing healthcare data and transactions
 Gaming Industry Supports effective handling of player engagements transactions and data within online gaming platforms
 Social Media Platforms Manages usergenerated content interactions and realtime updates efficiently
 Supply Chain Management SCM Addresses the challenges of complex and dynamic supply chain networks efficiently

1cozepu,ParallelCommittees A Novelle Secure and HighPerformance Distributed Database Architecture,"In my PhD thesis I proposed a novel faulttolerant selfconfigurable scalable secure decentralized and highperformance distributed database replication architecture named Parallel Committees

I utilized an innovative sharding technique to enable the use of Byzantine Fault Tolerance BFT consensus mechanisms in very largescale networks

With this innovative full sharding approach supporting both processing sharding and storage sharding as more processors and replicas join the network the system computing power and storage capacity increase unlimitedly while a classic BFT consensus is utilized

My approach also allows an unlimited number of clients to join the system simultaneously without reducing system performance and transactional throughput

I introduced several innovative techniques for distributing nodes between shards processing transactions across shards improving security and scalability of the system proactively circulating committee members and forming new committees automatically

I introduced an innovative and novel approach to distributing nodes between shards using a public key generation process called KeyChallenge that simultaneously mitigates Sybil attacks and serves as a proofofwork The KeyChallenge idea is published in the peerreviewed conference proceedings of ACM ICCTA 2024 Vienna Austria

In this regard I proved that it is not straightforward for an attacker to generate a public key so that all characters of the key match the ranges set by the systemI explained how to automatically form new committees based on the rate of candidate processor nodes

The purpose of this technique is to optimally use all network capacity so that inactive surplus processors in the queue of a committee that were not active are employed in the new committee and play an effective role in increasing the throughput and the efficiency of the system

This technique leads to the maximum utilization of processor nodes and the capacity of computation and storage of the network to increase both processing sharding and storage sharding as much as possible

In the proposed architecture members of each committee are proactively and alternately replaced with backup processors This technique of proactively circulating committee members has three main results

 a preventing a committee from being occupied by a group of processor nodes for a long time period in particular Byzantine and faulty processors
 b preventing committees from growing too much which could lead to scalability issues and latency in processing the clients requests
 c due to the proactive circulation of committee members over a given timeframe there exists a probability that several faulty nodes are excluded from the committee and placed in the committee queue Consequently during this timeframe the faulty nodes in the committee queue do not impact the consensus process

This procedure can improve and enhance the fault tolerance threshold of the consensus mechanismI also elucidated strategies to thwart the malicious action of KeyWithholding where previously generated public keys are prevented from future shard access The approach involves periodically altering the acceptable ranges for each character of the public key The proposed architecture effectively reduces the number of undesirable crossshard transactions that are more complex and costly to process than intrashard transactions

I compared the proposed idea with other shardingbased data replication systems and mentioned the main differences which are detailed in Section 47 of my dissertation

The proposed architecture not only opens the door to a new world for further research in this field but also represents a significant step forward in enhancing distributed databases and data replication systems

The proposed idea has been published in the peerreviewed conference proceedings of IEEE BCCA 2023

Additionally I provided an explanation for the decision not to employ a blockchain structure in the proposed architecture an issue that is discussed in great detail in Chapter 5 of my dissertation

The complete version of my dissertation is accessible via the following link 

I compared my proposed database architecture with various distributed databases and data replication systems in Section 47 of my dissertation This comparison included Apache Cassandra Amazon DynamoDB Google Bigtable Google Spanner and ScyllaDB I strongly recommend reviewing that section for better clarity and understanding

The main problem is as follows  
  
Classic consensus mechanisms such as Paxos or PBFT provide strong and strict consistency in distributed databases However due to their low scalability they are not commonly used Instead methods such as eventual consistency are employed which while not providing strong consistency offer much higher performance compared to classic consensus mechanisms The primary reason for the low scalability of classic consensus mechanisms is their high time complexity and message complexity  
  
I recommend watching the following video explaining this matter  
  
  
My proposed architecture enables the use of classic consensus mechanisms such as Paxos PBFT etc in very large and highscale networks while providing very high transactional throughput This ensures both strict consistency and high performance in a highly scalable network This is achievable through an innovative approach of parallelization and sharding in my proposed architecture  
  
If needed I can provide more detailed explanations of the problem and the proposed solution

1c8lig4,Reporting system for microservices,"Hi
we are trying to implement a reporting system for our microservices our goal is to build a business intelligence service that correlates data between multiple services

Right now for legacy services there is an ETL service that reads data sql queries from source databases and then stores it in a data warehouse where data is enriched and prepared for the end user

For microservices and in general for everything that is not legacy we want to avoid this approach because multiple kinds of databases are involved es postgresql and mongodb and our ETL service need to read an high amount of data including things that has not been changed every day very slow and inefficient

Because people of data team the one who manage ETL jobs and business intelligence stuff are not the same of dev team every time a dev team decides to change something eg schema database engine etc our ETL service stops working and this requires a lot of over coordination and sharing of low level implementation details

We want to obtain the same level of backwards compatibility between changes and abstraction used for servicetoservice interaction REST API but for data delegating the dev team to maintain that layer of backwards compatibility contract with data team also because direct access to source databases and implementation details is an antipattern for microservices


A first test was made using debezium to stream changes from sources database to kafka and then s3 using iceberg as table format in a kind of data lake while using trino as query engine
This approach seems to be very experimental and difficult to maintainoperate eg what happens with a huge amount of insertedupdated data
In addition to that it is not clear how to maintain the data backwards compatibilityabstraction layer one possible way could be to delegate it to dev teams allowing them to create views on data lake

1c39g6g,How can I derive associations between player positions,"So I have a csv containing football data about goals where each goal has a scorer GCA1the player that gave assist GCA2the player that gave the pass to the assister 

I want to discover patterns of player positions that lead to a goal AKA buildups to a goal

Example RB passed to a CAM which assisted a goal scored by a ST or CB passed to a RW which assisted a goal scored by a LW

I want to find the most frequent buildups think of it as finding frequent itemsets for a supermarket to derive discount decisions Except my goal is to know which buildups are most common and make up coaching plans to better strengthen the relationship between the players in those buildups

I was thinking of using APRIORI algorithm or FPGrowth I tried CHATGPT but it didnt help me that much Im getting only one association between FW players and no one or sort of saying forward players scoring solo which is definitely not logical based on my dataset and gemini is the most awful AI out there Seriously my grandma can do better I gave it a prompt and rephrased it 3 times and it still gave me Rephrase your prompt and try again 

So does anyone know a way I can do this or if there is a way to do it better Im still a junior data scientist so Im still learning and I would gladly appreciate any feedback or advice",1,1,2024-04-13 19:06:24,bigdata,54,1296
1c1fma9,Example Data Pipeline with Prefect Delta Lake and Dask,"Im an OSS developer primarily working on Dask and lately Ive been talking to users about how theyre using Dask for ETLstyle production workflows and this inspired me to make something myself I wanted a simple example that met the following criteria  
   
 Run locally optionally Should be easy to try out locally and easily scalable    
 Scalable to cloud I didnt want to think hard about cloud deployment    
 Python forward I wanted to use tools familiar to Python users not an ETL expert    
The resulting data pipeline uses Prefect for workflow orchestration Dask to scale the data processing across a cluster Delta Lake for storage and Coiled to deploy Dask on the cloud  
   
I really like the outcome but wanted to get more balanced feedback since lately Ive been more on the side of building these tools rather than using them heavily for data engineering Some questions Ive had include    
 Prefect vs Airflow vs Dagster For the users Ive been working with at Coiled Prefect is the most commonly used tool I also know Dagster is quite popular and could easily be swapped into this example    
 DeltaLake or something else To be honest I mostly see vanilla Parquet in the wild but Ive been curious about Delta for a while and mostly wanted an excuse to try it out pandas and Dask support improved a lot with deltars    
   
Anyway if people have a chance to read things over and give feedback Id welcome constructive critique

1bv99j8,Understanding Conversion Attribution in Marketing,"Conversion attribution is a crucial concept in marketing analytics that helps businesses understand the impact of their marketing efforts and allocate resources effectively In simple terms it refers to the process of assigning credit to different marketing channels or touchpoints for driving conversions or sales

There are several different models of attribution each with its own strengths and weaknesses Here are some common attribution models and how they affect marketing decisions

1 Last Click Attribution This model assigns all the credit for a conversion to the last touchpoint a customer interacted with before converting While this model is simple and easy to implement it often overvalues direct response channels like paid search and undervalues other channels that contribute to the customer journey
2 First Click Attribution In contrast to last click attribution this model gives all the credit to the first touchpoint a customer interacted with While this model can help businesses understand the initial customer acquisition journey it may overlook the influence of later touchpoints that drive conversions
3 Linear Attribution This model evenly distributes credit across all touchpoints in the customer journey While it provides a more balanced view of the customer journey it may not accurately reflect the true impact of each touchpoint on conversion
4 Time Decay Attribution This model gives more credit to touchpoints that occur closer to the time of conversion while giving less credit to touchpoints that occur earlier in the customer journey While this model recognizes the importance of recency in influencing conversion it may undervalue touchpoints that contribute to brand awareness and consideration earlier in the journey
5 PositionBased Attribution Also known as Ushaped attribution this model gives more credit to the first and last touchpoints in the customer journey while giving less credit to touchpoints in the middle This model acknowledges the importance of both initial touchpoints that introduce customers to a brand and final touchpoints that drive conversion

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different attribution models businesses can make more informed decisions about how to allocate their marketing budgets and optimize their campaigns for maximum impact While no single attribution model is perfect using a combination of models or customizing attribution models to fit your business goals can provide a more accurate picture of the customer journey and drive better results

3 Use colors effectively Colors can be a powerful tool for highlighting important information and drawing attention to key insights in your visualizations However its important to use them judiciously to avoid overwhelming your audience Stick to a consistent color palette and use contrasting colors to differentiate between different data categories Avoid using too many colors in a single chart as this can make it difficult to interpret
4 Add context Providing context is essential for helping viewers interpret your visualizations accurately Add labels titles and descriptions to your charts to explain what theyre showing and why its important Consider including annotations or callouts to draw attention to specific data points or trends Adding context helps ensure that your visualizations are meaningful and actionable for your audience
5 Embrace interactivity Power BI offers powerful interactive features that allow viewers to explore and interact with your data dynamically Take advantage of these features to create engaging and immersive visualizations that encourage exploration and discovery Add slicers filters and drilldown capabilities to enable viewers to dive deeper into the data and uncover insights on their own

Given N items N  108 each item has a list of unique items that is related to it The average size of the related list of an item is about 5000 The problem is each time a list of items is given with size  103 items we have to return the number of unique items in the concatenated list of all the related items of at least 1 item in the given list

 Input Each line is the item id and its related items So the input matrix is around 108  103
 Output
    When given a list of X X  103 items we have to concatenate the lists of related items of X items and return the number of unique items

Example

Input

1 2 3 4

2 1 3 5

3 1 2

4 2 5

5 1 4

So the item 1 is related to 2 3 4 item 2 is related to 1 3 5 item 3 is related to 1 2 and so on  
If the query is 1 4 then the answer is 4 the list is 2 3 4 5  2 3 4  2 5

Requirements

1be2fah,Getting started with big data,"Hi folks Im with a small but growing company Our data sets are growing quickly and need to be moved out of the operational data stores  mainly MySQL but remain accessible for historical analysis

Ive been researching big data strategies and have found the number of available tools and technologies to be overwhelming Given that incremental learning can be costly in terms of time and effort due to the sheer volume of data Im wondering where best to begin

As I said I need to offload historical data from the operational database but still be able to access it Theres no immediate need for realtime queries but its quite possible that there will be in the very near future Just moving it from one relational store to another been there done that only puts off solving the problem

So I need to move it somewhere but where We are in an AWS environment so is it S3 Hadoop NoSQL Kafka  And presumably this choice will affect the decision of what tools to use to access it for historical views within the application And I cant start moving the data until I also have a way to access it

Would be wide open to an answer being to read this book or take this course Its just hard to know which given that everyone seems to be trying to peddle their particular solution

1b9mgmo,Need Help Optimizing MySQL for 100 Concurrent Users,"I cant get concurrent users to increase no matter the servers CPU power

Hello Im working on a production web application that has a giant MySQL database at the backend The database is constantly updated with new information from various sources at different timestamps every single day The web application is reportgenerationbased where the user generates reports of data from a certain time range they specify which is done by querying against the database This querying of MySQL takes a lot of time and is CPU intensive observed from htop MySQL contains various types of data especially largestring data Now to generate a complex report for a single user it uses 1 CPU thread or vCPU not the whole number of CPUs available Similarly for 4 users 4 CPUs and the rest of the CPUs are idle I simulate multiple concurrent users report generation tests using the PostMan application Now no matter how powerful the CPU I use it is not being efficient and caps at around 3040 concurrent users powerful CPU results in higher caps and also takes a lot of time

When multiple users are simultaneously querying the database all logical cores of the server become preoccupied with handling MySQL queries which in turn reduces the applications ability to manage concurrent users effectively For example a single user might generate a report for one months worth of data in 5 minutes However if 20 to 30 users attempt to generate the same report simultaneously the completion time can extend to as much as 30 minutes Also when the volume of concurrent requests grows further some users may experience failures in receiving their report outputs successfully

I am thinking of parallel computing and using all available CPUs for each report generation instead of using only 1 CPU but it has its disadvantages If a rogue user constantly keeps generating very complex reports other users will not be able to get fruitful results So Im currently not considering this option

Is there any other way I can improve this from a query perspective or any other perspective Please can anyone help me find a solution to this problem What type of architecture should be used to keep the same performance for all concurrent users and also increase the concurrent users cap our requirement is about 100 concurrent users

I recently received an offer for a Data Analyst position at a company as a new grad with a Bachelors in Statistics and Id love to hear your thoughts on my situation

The role is completely new at the company they have never worked with data before aside from some basic Power BI visualizations using SQL My concern is whether I as a new grad will be capable of kickstarting their datadriven decisionmaking without a senior analyst or a team of analysts to guide me Im worried about not having anyone to fall back on when facing challenges 

Additionally the job description includes process automation using Power Automate They want to streamline their orderhandling process such as ensuring the right person gets an email based on the ordered product sending automated confirmation emails to customers when an order is placed or shipped and generating alerts when inventory is running low To me this sounds more like an IT or operations role rather than a typical data analyst position and Im unsure whether I have the skills to fulfill these expectations Or is it ok for a data analyst to take care of such tasks as well

Currently Im enrolled in a Masters program in Statistics but I feel like I might learn more by gaining realworld experience as a Data Analyst rather than just working with perfect datasets in R all day

What do you guys think Should I take the job and learn on the go or would it be too risky to hop out the masters for a fresh started data analyst role at a company I have a feeling one would learn and become a better analyst if I got a job where there is already a data driven culture to sort of guide me Any advice would be greatly appreciated",20,26,2025-01-22 00:43:46,analytics,49,1687

1i6mdw7,Building a Minimalistic BI Stack with PostgreSQL FDW and Superset  Looking for Feedback,"Hey everyone Im in the process of setting up a lightweight BI Business Intelligence architecture and would love to hear your thoughts before I go too far down the rabbit hole Heres the broad outline

 My Setup

1 Dedicated PostgreSQL BI Server
    I have a separate Postgres instance just for analytics ie not the production DB I really dont want Superset or heavy queries hitting prod directly
2 Foreign Data Wrapper FDW
    Im using FDW on the BI Postgres to pull data from the production DB and potentially from other sources in the future This way I can query external tables without actually copying them over or building huge ETL pipelines right now
3 Materialized Views
    On the BI Postgres Im creating materialized views to store preaggregated data The idea is to speed up reporting queries and reduce the load on both the BI and production DB Ill refresh these on a schedule using either pgcron or a simple script
4 Apache Superset for Visuals
    Ill point Superset at the BI Postgres so I can build dashboards from the materialized views Im trying to keep everything costeffective and as simple as possible

 Why Im Doing This

 FinOps  Simplicity I want to avoid a giant stack or expensive cloud services for moderate data volumes Were already comfortable with Postgres so it made sense to leverage it fully
 Avoid Overloading Production I really dont want to connect Superset directly to the production DB Im hoping FDW plus a separate BI Postgres instance is a safe approach

 What Im Unsure About

1 FDW Performance Have you seen any issues with slow queries when using FDW for relatively large tables Ive read about query pushdown being pretty good but Im worried about network overhead or unexpected performance hits
2 Materialized View Refresh Right now Im planning on refreshing them daily or maybe hourly for certain critical tables Any advice on how to handle partial vs full refreshes
3 Scaling Is this going to become a nightmare if data volumes suddenly jump I realize I might need to move to something more robust if we get hammered with queries But how do you all handle that growth path
4 Security  Access Controls Are there any best practices I should consider for user roles especially to ensure people only see the data theyre allowed to see in Superset

 Questions for the Community

 Is this approach workable in the long run or is it an earlystage hack

1i61xtb,What are the best entry level jobs that help you get into data analytics,"Ive noticed a lot of people here are saying that a job in data analytics isnt really an entry level position and you usually have to have worked in another job for a while before moving to data analytics

1st year Didnt do much

2nd year Joined 2 finance clubs my 2nd year thinking I was going to pursue Investment Banking Realized that a 90 hour work week was not for me so I decided not to pursue that path

3rd year Took a data analytics class and intro comp sci class during the Fall semester Turns out I enjoyed technical work more than making stock pitches so decided to add a Business Analytics major and a Comp Sci minor Took 3 business analytics classes and 1 cs class during the Winter semester and realized most BA courses were poorly structured and often unavailable due to lack of professors Figured taking Comp Sci classes would be a better investment of my time and money

4th year Took 3 cs classes last semester F2024 and currently taking 2 this semester 

Currently have a 375 GPA and will be graduating next year in may W2026

Have used Python Pandas NumPy Scikitlearn SQL PowerBI R Java Excel PowerPoint for class assignmentsprojects nothing too complicated



Due to family constraints I was not able to work during my time at uni and as a result have no internship experience Things have changed this year though so I am now able to pursue internships Since I am at the end of my 4th year I have F2025 W2026 and possibly S2026 to gain internship experience

So I guess Im looking for advice on how to move forward towards getting an internship within data analytics I know a solid portfolio is super important so that should be 1st step but I dont know what projects to do and where to even begin Ideally Id want to leverage my finance background to land a data analystbusiness intelligence role within the finance sector so any ideas for projects would be very appreciated Also what skills should I learnrefine what booksresources should I be readingusing to put myself in a better position to land an internship Honestly just looking for general tips on the steps I need to take atm

they started by asking me some theory stuff discuss the differences between sets lists dicts whats a tuple etc which I did really well on because of my math background that sort of stuff is my strongest area I can remember theory much more easily than I can remember precise syntax then we did some pandas shit and I completely froze up for a second had to google group by and something else but I told them that I was like really panicking in the moment and freezing up I was able to do some of the other stuff they asked for transform a column and turn it into a new column I optimized the work with a lambda function I dont fucking know then some more theory stuff whats an array in numpy which I sort of answered its a multidimensional vector or tensor I also said I was pretty sure every element had to be of the same type but I wasnt able to speak to the more technical components since I dont directly work with numpy often 

then there was a sql question I did ok on the first question though it took a bit of prompting second question I didnt understand it was something about primary keys and regular keys and I was like yeah I completely forgot what a regular key is then the third question was to write a query which was easy

1i286j9,How to drive business outcomes with data and AI products price optimization,"We must not forget that our job is to create value with our data initiatives So here is an example of how to drive business outcome

CASE STUDY Machine learning for price optimization in grocery retail perishable and nonperishable products

BUSINESS SCENARIO A grocery retailer that sells both perishable and nonperishable products experiences inventory waste and loss of revenue The retailer lacks dynamic pricing model that adjusts to realtime inventory and market conditions

Consequently they experience the following

1 Perishable items often expire unsold leading to waste

2 Nonperishable items are often overdiscounted This reduces profit margins unnecessarily

METHOD Historical data was collected for perishable and nonperishable items depicting shelf life competitor pricing trends seasonal demand variations weather holidays including customer purchasing behavior frequency preferences and price sensitivity etc

Data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and machine learning models were deployed owning to their ability to handle large datasets Linear regression or gradient boosting algorithm was employed to predict demand elasticity for each item This is to identify how sensitive demand is to price changes across both categories The models were trained evaluated and validated to ensure accuracy

INFERENCE For perishable items the model generated realtime pricing adjustments based on remaining shelf life to increase discounts as expiry dates approach to boost sales and minimize waste

For nonperishable items the model optimized prices based on competitor trends and historical sales data For instance prices were adjusted during peak demand periods eg holidays to maximize profitability

For crosscategory optimization Apriori algorithm was able to identify complementary products eg milk and cereal for discount opportunities and bundles to increase basket size to optimize margins across both categories These models were continuously fed new data and insights to improve its accuracy

CONCLUSION Companies in the grocery retail industry can reduce waste from perishables through dynamic discounts Also they can improve profit margins on nonperishables through targeted price adjustments With this grocery retailers can remain competitive while maximizing profitability and sustainability

In my current company for example were expected to find new insights regularly but everything is done using SQL and Tableau While these tools are fine for certain tasks doing deeper data exploration with them can feel tedious and limiting Were also not encouraged to use statistical knowledge at all since no one on the team including our boss has a statistical background It feels like theres no understanding or value placed on applying more advanced techniques We just need to have exceptional data storytelling skills  put up some nice figures which confirm already known intuitions

Honestly Im feeling a bit frustrated I cant help but wonder if this is common across the field or if its just the nature of certain industries or companies Would things be different in a more techfocused company or in a dedicated data science role

1i1akf5,Need help deciding which route to take for transition into DA,"Hi everyone  

I bet this is a pretty much always asked question and sorry for asking it again but i would like some answers specific to my situation 

First lemme say i live in France for some context so things are a bit different here 

I have 2 masters in engineering one in Material Science and the other in Space Systems from 2 highly recognized schools  i did my final year at Imperial College in the UK 

I have worked 2 years as an RD engineer in microelectronics doing 40 of theorical physics and the other basically doing the job of a data analyst The firm i was in had no data person whatsoever so i kinda became it and built a whole application in VBA to extract transform load analyse and dashboard data coming from our devices tests Did some python and Power BI dashboarding while i was there 

 I am saying all this because i keep reading posts where ppl say that a degree is the most imporrtant thing in the field and a bootcamp in case you have the diploma will help but not as much 

So i have a degree in a related field but we kinda did everything you do as a DA or even DS A lot of proba stats machine learning math python and such

I quit my job a few months ago now and im lost between doing a bootcamp and pay 5k for it to learn more DA skills and have the certification or going the self taught route and build a learning path to be as close as the bootcamps one using DataCamp or Maven analytics resources

On the one hand selfteaching would save me a lot of money and theres a ton of free or affordable resources out there On the other hand bootcamps offer access to career coaching and industry networks which could be invaluable for landing a job A structured curriculum might also keep me on track and ensure I dont miss any key concepts plus they often provide realworld projects that would help me build a portfolio

So i woul really need your advice here and what you think would be the best choice considering my background and situation 

  
TLDR Im an engineer with two masters degrees and two years of data analysis related experience trying to decide between an expensive data science bootcamp and selfteaching Looking for advice on which route might be better for breaking into data analytics

Im a Jr Analyst working with Power BI and SharePoint and my manager tasked me with fixing slow data refresh times for one of our reports Currently were connecting to Excel files stored in a SharePoint folder using a basic web connection which seems to be the bottleneck

My manager requires that the refreshes be done in Power BI Desktop and the reports to then be uploaded to the Power BI Service Additionally we rely on Power Automate flows to handle some parts of our workflow These flows open up websites download data and upload it to SharePoint However this setup requires our laptops to remain running for the process to work which isnt ideal for a nightly refresh scenario

My manager suggested exploring the SharePoint API as a potential solution to improve refresh performance They dont mind how its done as long as the data refresh speeds up significantly

Ive already looked at a few tutorials and articles but Im hoping someone with experience can point me to the best resources videos articles or guides to optimize this process Id appreciate help in cutting through bad advice and finding the most effective solution

1hror9q,Is it as bad as that guy said,"So I saw that post recently where OP was a bit frustrated with the influx of new people trying to break into data analysis and not understanding what they are exactly getting into Seemed like frustration with expectations of ease and salary as well as availability with them noting a declining job market 

Should I be tuning this out and driving or should I heed the alarms and go back where I came from 

I ask because Ive just chosen to go down this past Ive done a lot of research and the job does genuinely sound like what I want to do Ive been researching different jobs for almost 2 years now and this is the first thing I said I really wanted to do from deep inside of me I know its not just some easy fun remote gig shortcut to 200k BUT arent jobs just hard in general Not to say anything about data analytics but millions of jobs deal with overcoming new challenges struggling to meet deadlines and the alternatives are destroying your body doing manual labor or losing all opportunities to see family and maintain healthy relationships 

Ive been working in hospitality for going on 7 years now Ive come to realize I can feel my body being worn down almost everyone Ive met more senior struggles to be even a little happy I havent gotten a major holiday off in maybe 3 years I would do a lot to be able to spend Christmas with my family or go to Thanksgiving 

My understanding is it will be a lot of hard work to even get an entry level job My plan was simply to work hard everyday try to get some certifications that show I am capable of learning and working hard and maybe eventually I will get an entry level position I expect no tech salary and that isnt even a long term goal I dont expect it to be easy though and I do expect it to still be a job only so enjoyable 

Ive chosen this route because going back to school for a degree in it in person would be almost impossible working full time and getting an online degree even would be at least 3 years and tens of thousands of dollars Not to mention I fail to meet GPA requirements simply because I was too immature to apply myself as a kid I did well enough sleeping through most classes and just passing tests that I never learned how to learn I was not an idiot in any way except the fact that I was too short sighted to begin building my future 

Ive now learned how to learn and filled with drive to build these skills Ive seen what life is like in service and its not what I want and I believe that hard work can eventually make something

Am I just another hopeful imbecile wasting his time or is there truth that I can get an entry level job with hard work and multiple certifications 

Hope this post is allowed by the rules Im not seeking career advice or assistance but I DO want to hear it from the community directly whether or not this is some bleak industry not even worth anyones time or if there is hope

1hrocwx,Best Resources For SQL Interview Questions,"Hi everyone

Following the positive response to my previous post Best Practical Way to Learn SQL I wanted to share the next step in your learning journey practicing real interview questions

In a typical Data Analyst or Analytics interview youll encounter these stages

 1 Technical Screening

 Often a HackerRank or similar test designed to filter candidates based on technical proficiency

 2 Hiring Manager Round

 A discussion with the hiring manager focusing on your work experience problemsolving skills and understanding of business concepts

 3 Technical Rounds 12

 SQLfocused round This tests your hard skills such as query writing and problemsolving with databases
 Product Case Study varies by company A more indepth exploration of your analytical thinking and approach to productrelated problems more on this in a future post

 4 CrossTeamStakeholder Round

 A soft skills round assessing your ability to collaborate with other teams and communicate effectively

Look at this pattern we realise that SQL is the cornerstone of success in most Data Analytics interviews While other factors like communication and business understanding matter as a hiring manager Ive often observed that candidates are underprepared for the SQL round

Just like coding rounds are essential for Software Engineering roles SQL proficiency is crucial for entrylevel Data Analytics positions When you lack prior experience technical skills often carry the most weight

Ive said it before and Ill say it again the technical screening round can make or break your interview

 Recommended Resources for SQL Practice

Here are some resources Ive personally used and recommend to ace SQL interview questions

 1 LeetCode Database Section

 Start with the free SQL questions  no need for a subscription initially
 Explore the SQL 50 Questions list as a structured starting point

 2 DataLemur

 A dedicated platform for SQL interview questions
 Use this after completing the free questions on LeetCode
 Again no need to buy anything the free section is good to begin with

 3 StrataScratch

 Offers SQL questions alongside other analyticsrelated technical problems

 4 HackerRank SQL Section

 Not the most comprehensive but worth completing for its free and limited set of questions

 Pro Tips for SQL Prep

1 Practice Consistently Go through the resources 23 times to build speed and intuition
2 Bookmark Tough Questions Track questions that challenge you so you can revisit them during subsequent practice rounds

1hr493m,What are peoples reasons for trying to break into analytics still,"Each day I see numerous posts about people attempting to break into analytics with the most random backgrounds that make them less than ideal candidates They likely face a massive uphill battle to break into an analytics related role

Why does this keep happening

Do people believe theres still a huge boom in the job market for analytics

It just confuses me to be honest given how saturated the field is and bleak the job market is right now You have an exponentially increasing supply of labor and decreasing demand for it

Edit it appears that a few people are getting upset and think that I am gatekeeping All I am asking is what are poeples motivations to try and enter this field It seems like many people think were in a 202122 situation where you can complete a bootcamp or masters with no relevant experience or domain knowledge and then have the opportunity to jump right into the industry with a hybridremote role as a data analystscientist etc I personally think people are getting influenced by trendy influenceryoutube videos and universities creating these programs

Obviously people can do as they wish I dont care its just a job However I worry that many of the people posting about how they want to break in dont understand the true nature of the general job market and the analytics industry in particular No shit most industries are saturated right now but analytics is clearly at a higher level due to the combination of hype offshoring and cooling of the overall job market

I feel bad for the individuals who have decided to complete a bootcamp a MS in analytics or just graduated with an irrelevant degree and possess zero domain knowledge with few analytical skills but want to completely jump ship and break into analytics Theyre going down a path thatll likely lead to hundreds maybe even over a 1000 applications with most being rejections and ultimately making a failed investment

They can do what they want however I worry that many people think the barrier to entry is much lower than it truly is and are making poor decisions",158,119,2025-01-01 14:46:02,analytics,65,2060

Heres what heled me when I was getting started 

 Go to google and search Mode SQL Tutorial
 It is a free documentation of the SQL concepts that have been summarised in a practical manner
 I highly recommend going through them in order if youre a total newbie trying to learn SQL
 The best part  You can practise the concepts right then and there in the free SQL editor and actually implement the concepts that you have just learned   

Rinse and repeat for this until your conformatable with how to write SQL queries

1hpl9hx,Why operational analysts should sit in financeone opinion,"Operational analysts should sit in Finance not IT or scattered across business units Heres why

Key Benefits

 They develop better financial awareness and can tie analysis directly to ROIbottom line impact
 More consistent methods and data quality across the company when centralized in Finance
 Resources get allocated based on company priorities not department politics
 Better career growth path with exposure to senior leadership
 Analysts get broader business context vs being stuck in one departments silo

Common Pushback

 But theyll lose touch with operations  Nope just set up proper rotations and communication channels
 They need IT support  Modern tools reduce this need and you can still partner with IT while focusing on business outcomes
 Wont it slow down urgent requests  Not with proper service agreements and priority frameworks

You dont want your analysts becoming Excel jockeys in IT or getting buried in one departments bubble Finance gives them the perfect mix of business context and technical opportunity while keeping them focused on actual value creation",17,17,2024-12-30 11:26:34,analytics,57,1083

1hptn8m,Free Database Tool for Novice Personal Project,"I would like to create a smallish database to analyze trading card game decklists similar to limitlesstcgcom I am a novice data builder and would like to use a free tool to build the data sets The basics are as such
1 An event will have an event type date location players who use a discrete decklist the number of players and therefore lists will vary by event and placement in the event
2 Track pairings of players the scale would be small as most results I am tracking would be among the top 816 players
2 Each decklist will have a minimum of 1 leader one starting location and 50 cards with an additional sideboard of 10 cards maximum
3 Cards that are included in the decklists can be in multiples and have characteristics that I would like to analyze cost power aspectaffiliation etc

With these data sets I would like to analyze
1 Popularity of a particular leader and occasionally the starting location over an adjustable period of time
2 The most frequently used cards with that leaderlocation pair  this choice realistically eliminates the majority of cards that could be included in a deck and in what quantities
3 Identify the most common place of the most frequently used cards either in main deck or sideboard
4 Characteristics of the cards chosen for deck data sets

Assuming I have a decklist creator that generates a file in a specific format with names quantities placement of the cards would like to ingest the data from those files for the raw data The data can be stored locally but would lean toward something that could eventually be stored online andor entered from multiple users

1hoifpj,Data analysis or cybersecurity,"Hello all

I am considering starting a new career path after years of stagnant career growth within trust and safety and GenAI 

I have done much research and I have come down to either data analytics or cybersecurity

Cybersecurity because what had motivated me to follow tech in the first place years ago was protecting users from harm internal content and external But since then trust and safety has been all over the place from content moderation to customer support and of course lots of layoffs ans outsourcing

Data analysis because I have some familiarity with analysis concepts and tools mostly excel and I have found trends and insights through large datasets I thought this would be a better choice since I already have some experience and just need to aquire more technical skills and create a decent portfolio 

But something about cybersecurity has always intrigued me and feels like something more meaningful for me in the long run I do understand that the general consensus is that cybersecurity is no entry level job and requires some time in IT helpdesk roles which Im fine with before landing a threat intelligence role ethical hacking red teaming or anything or the like 

I would really appreciate some guidance here on which is a better career path for me Again I am not asking what exactly to do as I can always do more research in this subreddit Just advice from a pro or two on whether one or the other is the right career path for me

1hh56t7,Is it reasonable of my bosses to expect us to be data analyst and an economist Unsure of what to learn anymore,"For some context my current team is very small and my daily work unfortunately involves churning adhoc data requests internal stakeholders than data projects When i mean data projects i refer to dashboards and playing around with data on a specific topic

Lately my bosses also expect us to do econometric modelling but they are not trained ij economics I have undergraduate background in economics but I feel that this is always insufficient as many theoretical stuff are only taught in graduate school  as confirmed by my teammate who has graduate school knowledge in economics

On a related note my teammate also have extensive knowledge in programming and database including creating test suites reading SQL scripts and API calling All these were not part of my job scope and job description at all Worst part is I have zero clue on how to begin them

2 How can I improve my knowledge in econometrics I use R without graduate school Its too expensive for me and my company cannot sponsor me

1hhjl86,Am I being asked to do too much,"Im sitting just a little over 60k 6061k and Im also at the lowest grade role that the company offers Still an analyst but theres other analyst roles admin reporting etc that are higher grades

Im building out an org chart model I need to be able to

 build an org chart from our server doing through PowerBI data from sql

 compare that org chart to a shouldbe chart

 theres multiple charts for different operating segments and they all have different nuances and numbers

Soheres a few overrides Im doing to that allow us to make changes to our chart will still ingesting data directly from source

 need manual overrides for employees whose managers are incorrect fixing the source data is not an option because another incorrect record will show up before we can fix the first onecycle repeats

 need manual overrides for certain jobs in the event a standard job shows up as multiple titles codes senior vs nonsenior

 standard structures things that dont change like every operating division will have 1 accountant

 changing structures things that might be based on number of sales locations in a given area ingested from another table

 overrides things that vary by region and dont follow the rules outlined above

Then I need to build out positionids for these charts which is complicated enough but Im basically just planning to take how many of this role are there and index it the unique role so we can have eg salesperson1 salesperson2 and then I would need to index the actual chart and join the employees to the shouldbe chart

My actual big concern in all this is that its getting hairy At first I thought it would be pretty simple conceptually and it was but now Im adding a lot of levers to a tool that I may not even own long term Im thinking about how I might have to make a data dictionary to explain this thing and it just concerns me at the thought of someone else having to own this and figure out what the fck this thing is Its going to be used by nondata stakeholders so I need it to be at least moderately user friendly

My other issues mainly have to do with the fact that it feels like Im basically building out an applicationsoftwaretool This isnt just analysis its not just pulling data its not even some of the cool data modeling I didhave done as an intern Its messy but I cant figure out a more robust way to do this with all the it should work this way but there might be some exceptions Does this at least sound like it matches my pay I cant tell if this is a lot to ask for me or not I can see the whole thing in my head because Im good at this stuff but that makes it harder for me to gauge if this is something an entry level analyst with a good head on their shoulders might be able to do vs something that you might be pushing your luck for

I know 60 is low but the company isnt reputed for their crazy salaries 60 is low for my company though for an analyst role but its the same low as another companys low by relativity 60 is slightly above median for my pay grade Anyways So like I know Im underpaid but Im just struggling to gauge if this genuinely is a pretty cumbersome ask or if its something youd expect a fresher to be able to figure out by themselves Frustrated because I feel like Im setup to fail at something by being asked too much Im not allowed to consult with other analystsdata scientists because its confidential work",3,22,2024-12-19 03:21:10,analytics,31,3379

1hghjmu,ship faster  ship better,"Hey I write a blog on product analytics why number go up and was curious to get feedback from some fellow analysts Does this resonate with your experience 

the perfection illusion

Have you fallen into analysis paralysis in hopes of finding the perfect answer Endless dashboards pristine PRDs and perfectly aligned roadmaps can feel like progress but theyre often just distractions You dont learn about user pain by sitting in meetings or refining models You only get there by shipping

The longer you wait the further you drift from reality

plans fail products evolve

No plan survives contact with the real world Heres the hard truth No matter how much you analyze you will never predict exactly what users want Take Slack It started as an internal communication tool for a game studio that failed What they thought was the perfect plan for a game became irrelevant By shipping fast and pivoting they built a communication product millions now rely on

Iteration always wins because user behavior is complex and assumptions break under realworld conditions

why shipping wins

Validate your assumptions

Every product decision you make is a guess until users validate it Shipping quickly gets those guesses into the wild and allows you to measure their impact Analysis might help prioritize what to build but only feedback tells you if it works

Example A team spends months improving a sophisticated search algorithm based on internal debates and assumptions After launch they realize users dont want improved search they are looking for better content If they had shipped improvement incrementally they would may have seen this in their metrics sooner

Bet small to win big

Shipping quickly isnt about cutting corners its about reducing risk Smaller faster releases help you make small bets instead of doubling down on a single highstakes feature Small bets let you adapt to what works Jeff Bezos calls this twoway doors Small decisions can easily be reversed or improved Ship them learn and iterate

Speed is good for morale

Teams that ship quickly build momentum Theyre learning constantly compounding improvements over time When speed is prioritized every small improvement adds up to better products and stronger teams Teams chasing the perfect launch move slowly get frustrated and secondguess their likely good intuitions

how to ship faster

1 Think small  Break large projects into atomic components that can validate hypotheses

2 Stop chasing complexity  Prioritize simple projects that solve for a known pain point over complex projects that solve a suspected one

3 Shipping as a metric  In the same vein of Elons what did you get done this week anchor your team on readily measurable indicators of throughput and celebrate wins

Shipping fast doesnt mean cutting corners It means getting real messy data from the only people who matter your users Youll never find the perfect product through analysis alone You can only iterate your way there and speed is what makes iteration possible

tldr

Stop overthinking Start shipping Iterate faster learn faster and youll build better products faster",5,6,2024-12-17 18:41:56,analytics,24,3113

1hg3t42,DAE gets worried about the oversimplification of Data analysis,"As the title says lately I feel like becoming a data analyst is being treated as a get rich quick scheme and honestly it really concerns me Let me explain why

First of all let me preface this by saying that I dont think this is the hardest career to get into Heck it probably wouldnt even crack the top 10 of hardest career pathsnor do I think it should I genuinely believe everyone should be able to earn a decent livable wage without having to study for 10 years Kudos to the ones who do tho

That said my main concern is how oversimplified data analysis is being portrayed Everywhere I look it feels like people are being told they can become a data analyst practically overnight The number of certifications and bootcamps has exploded in the last years and theres no sign of it slowing down Just Google data analysis right now and I guarantee most of the top results will be courses promising to turn you into a data analyst in three months one month or even just a couple of weeks

It honestly breaks my heart to see people signing up for these courses because I really dont think theyll get what they need to actually become data analysts Instead theyll probably just end up poorer and more frustrated Heck in a onemonth certification you might not even get a proper understanding of the difference between measures and calculated columns

So what do you folks think about this I know we could just laugh it off but I hate seeing people get scammed out of their money and watching my career path get devalued in the process",31,45,2024-12-17 05:35:21,analytics,62,1530

1hfxtgf,Best way to approach the job search for an entry level data position,"Hi everyone

  
Thanks for taking the time to check out my post here 

  
Little bit about me

  
Graduated from a target school for business and engineering in the NYC area with a bachelors degree in Information Systems and management in May of 2023 My coursework consisted of a few Excel classes an intro to Python class which was taught extremely poorly and a SQL class also taught poorly with a professor we had to report for harassment among other things 

  
The classes that were the most important to me were made obscenely difficult due to the poor communication teaching environment and my mental health This is supposed to be one of the greatest schools in the area for this kind of thing and I feel as though Ive gotten absolutely no where in my degree 

  
From December of 2022 to December of 2023 I applied to thousands of jobs all well within my qualifications and got no where Spoke to recruiters worked with my school and really tried my best to land anything 

  
I ended up getting a job as an IAE in sales for a VAR with an incredibly toxic work environment I took this just to get my out of my retail job and was promised Id make commission in 3 months which turned into 6 months and then a year Started this place in January of 2024 I figured Id try out sales to see if I like it but I want out 

  
My problem is my skills were never the best and now that its been almost 2 years since Ive graduated I feel like Im starting to miss the boat for this kind of thing This has been absolute hell to sit and go through the application process knowing nothing will get returned 

  
All I ask is the following

What skills should I focus on sharpening to better myself as a candidate and which courses would you recommend taking to sharpen said skills 

  
What approach should I take to applying to jobs Ive tried recruiters my school LinkedIn and looking for jobs on company websites 



This is the most dehumanizing experience and Im feeling defeated at this point Then my parents get on my case as to why they helped pay for such a phenomenal degree and that I cant do something with it 

Sorry for venting this just sucks

1hg58de,Analytics Career Progression,"Data science career progression go for PGD Business Analytics IIT B or IIITB or learn on own

Hi I am a working professional with 8 years of experience in analytics expertise in multiple tools Myqualifications BTech from NIT I am looking for a job switch as my growth and salary have stagnated but honestly on various job boards I have been unable to fetch even an interview I am seeing lot of job profiles asking for ML and some AI and statistics I have never had a certification in statistics Higher management roles require MBA PGDM Now I am exploring 3 options

1 IIT B newly launched ePGD in AI and DS It has got statistics as well in curriculum It is an extensive 18 months course but the good part that it is online

2 Similarly IIIT Bangalore with upGrad is offering Executive PGD in AI and DS 12 month course seems to have best reviews among other 12 month programs

3 Learn stuff online on own and get certifications on Edx coursera or Udemy Tutort DS program seems legit too

Now first 2 options give me a degree kind of certification which I am reading online is not considered as an eligible degree by employers
I cant do MBA at this point of time and I feel I wont be able to do it later as well due family and MBA programs taking 2 years and so much money

Its a common pitfall for data teams leadership has a constant stream of questions and you respond by building a 50chart dashboard nobody checks Product wants segmentation You deliver a sophisticated clustering model that never sees production Marketing wants acquisition tracking You perfect a complex attribution model that fails as soon as a new channel appears

Too often we trade tangible impact for false sophistication Sometimes these projects even earn praise fueling a cycle of busywork Youre working hard getting recognized but cant tie your hours to real results

In a datasaturated attentionaddled world theres no end of wellrationalized but lowimpact analytics work The key is to identify what moves the needlethe 20 of effort that yields 80 of the outcomes

The solution Break the loop Focus on decisions Your role is to help the organization make better faster decisions Everything else is secondary If your dashboards analyses or models dont directly inform a next step pause and rethink

As the title says Ive been a data  business analyst on the marketing team at my company for just over four years now and am considering looking for a new role however the issue is I have no idea what I even truly can call what I do I do a bit of everything but feel Im a master of none in the eyes of roles beyond what Im currently in Including my last position I have about six years of experience doing various work with SQL and Tableau

for the record I didnt run this through an AI program or anything so if it reads weirdly apologies

Since starting I have done and continue to do a variety of things

 Tableau
    The marketing team had no BIreporting prior to me so I got us into the Tableau ecosystem
    I currently create and manage multiple dashboards for 1520 people am the administrator for our Tableau portal handle all Tableau Prep Flows and the SQL pipeline used to power the viz layer
    All imposter syndrome aside I would say Im pretty good with Tableau Various people on my team have said theyve never seen somebody do in Tableau what I can do as quickly as I can do them including using Tableau for live table QA
 SQL and Data
    I am responsible for a large chunk of financial and virtually all surfaced marketing data at the company My job is heavily SQL based and touches on many different types of data from performance marketing to user retention to inproduct analytics using loglevel Mixpanel data
    I work with various teams to spec out important metrics where to source from platform portals working with devops to develop connections to our database mapping out how this should look at the table and reporting level and all QA from the digital channel to the database to the dashboards
    Various team members have told me that my SQL readability is unparalleled and window functions and stuff are pretty easy
 QA
    Our data is very dirty so a huge chunk of my time is spent doing QA  unit tests on data finding discrepancies and putting in tickets with our data team to rectify
 Reporting
    Im responsible for putting together all marketing reporting for csuite and the board of directors
    Due to a large chunk of our data not existing in the database and because marketers will never leave gSheets I also maintain every gSheet report
 Things I wish I had more opportunities to explore
    I help surface insights when I can however given my bandwidth its not feasible to do indepth exploratory analyses for andor alongside subject matter experts on each team
    I feel like Ive been funneled into a role building and maintaining reports and while I can and do offer insights into how campaigns perform I dont have a handson look into how our performance marketing is being tweaked by our agencies
    While I know how to use Python I havent done even a fizzbuzz in years I mainly use it for very basic API pulls in Databricks but havent had much experience with using python for stats
    My math isnt the strongest I have a degree in Econ and havent done a linear regression in over a decade at this point hah

For full transparency doing the above I an full time and currently make 133k a year and have had a consistent 20 bonus every year Bay Area

For context I have five years of experience working in an analytics role in a government organization in India My longterm goal is to transition to an international organization I initially applied to McGill because of its reputation and the programs alignment with my career aspirations but now Im reconsidering due to the financial burden

Additionally Ive applied to the Rotman School of Management University of Toronto and their decision will be released on December 23 McGill requires my decision by December 20

Here are my questions

1 Is McGills MS in Management Analytics worth the investment of CAD 80000 What is the ROI especially for international students with prior work experience
2 How does McGill compare to Rotman for analyticsfocused programs and job prospects in Canada
3 Does McGill allow extensions for decision deadlines Has anyone successfully requested one
4 Alternatively would it make sense to continue upskilling in India through certifications online courses etc and apply abroad later when I have more savings or a clearer plan

Id appreciate any insights from current students alumni or anyone familiar with these programs or the Canadian job market Thanks

1hbhr1o,Data Analytics worth pursuing in 2024 with no experience,"Hi everyone

Im in a bit of a crossroads in life and looking for some honest advice Im a 30yearold with a degree in Statistics from a university in the US but due to personal struggles including some mental health challenges Ive worked hard to address Ive been out of the workforce since graduating 8 years ago Unfortunately I have no professional experience in my fieldor any field really

That said Ive recently gotten serious about starting a career and data analytics has always intrigued me I enjoy problemsolving working with numbers and tools like Python make me feel confident and capable However Ive been struggling with doubts because the job market is obviously brutal right now Every time I hop on Reddit or LinkedIn I see posts about people with years of experience and polished portfolios struggling to get interviews Its discouraging to say the least

Ive been researching and planning to relearn SQL Python Tableau and Excel over the next few weeks My goal is to build a strong portfolio apply to smalltomidsized companies and avoid big tech giants where competition seems overwhelming But I cant shake the fear that my lack of experience and the 8year gap on my resume will make this a lost cause

So heres my question

 Is it realistic for someone in my situation to break into data analytics in the next year especially in the current job market
 Would upskilling and building a portfolio be worthwhile or should I pivot to another career path altogether

Im open to honest feedback even if its not what I want to hear I dont want to waste any more time if this path is a dead end Thanks so much for taking the time to read thisId really appreciate your advice or any words of encouragement or a reality check

TLDR 30 degree in Stats but no work experience 8year gap Want to pursue data analytics but worried the market is too saturated Is it worth it",47,18,2024-12-11 01:13:47,analytics,56,1871

1hb1ukh,HR Data Analyst Where should I go next with my career,"Hi everyone I am currently an HR Data Analyst in the UK I have been in HR for 5 years now and the last 2 years in HR analytics I am in a situation where I identified 3 possible routes to further develop my career but none feels right at the moment so if any senior data analyst or hr data analyst can give me some advice it would be very much appreciated

1 SQL  Python This is the path I find most appealing technically but because the last time I used SQL and Python Pandas intensively at work was already in 2022 and at the moment I mostly build things in Workday I dont have practice space and things get rusty I can still selflearn using Leetcode and building my projects but I am not sure if it would be enough to get my expected salary if I dont use it at work every day Due to personal responsibilities I am not open to a pay cut for learning at the moment
2 Advanced Statistics  Regression The good thing about HR data is that even though the size is smaller than product data or salesmarketing data I have room to play with most of them If I can do some data science work I think I can unlock a lot of insights for the organisation The problem is this is way harder to selflearn compared to SQL  Python I tried Google Advanced Certificate for a bit but after finishing the courses I still feel I am not ready to initiate an AB Testing or Multiple Linear Regression for a Turnover project in HR at all without guidance I have an assumption that only a Data Scientist would be the proper person to run this kind of project
3 Workday Data  Reporting This is the path that technically and financially makes the most sense to me as I am quite strong in building things in Workday already and can look for SeniorLead Workday Reporting  data roles in the future However whoever knows Workday will understand that its syntax is quite rubbish with a lot of repeated code and unnecessary manual work and I feel once I go deep into Workday it is hard to get out and learn any industrywide skills like SQL and Python anymore

I do want to get better in my career but at the moment all 3 options are not so clear to me Very much hope for some advises and thank you so much in advance",11,5,2024-12-10 13:34:20,analytics,53,2180

1hb6f2q,Business Analytics major vs MINS,"Hi all I will be attending Chico State Univeristy next sem to major is Finance but have been really interested in either Business Analytics or Management Information Systems as a double major or double concentration Im a little confused on what the main different is between BA and MINS According to my program descriptions it seems like BA is more managing data for business decisions with integration of machine learning AI and programming languages for processing data MINS is more designing and maintaining the data bases Both concentrations have a lot of overlap in the description and Im honestly surprised that the Business Analytics option would have techinical skills such as machine learning However it seems that MINS would cover the same topics

In the description of the MINS program it states The MINS option is the bridge that connects business with technology by focusing on innovative uses of technology to address business needs or to harness business opportunities However isnt Business Analytics kind of the same thing I have looked at the courses for both and they seem similar maybe just more data analytics for BA I have also done plenty of research online and it seems that the difference varies between universities

Here are some of the classes for each option for reference

Business Analytics Data Analytics Database Application Dev Business Intelligence  Data Warehousing Cloud Computing in Business

MINS Business Programming Data Communications  Networking Enterprise Resource Planning Systems Configuration and Use Business Systems Analysis

 I just wanted to get some opinions from folks who have majored in either of these



Yes I understand that Finance is a very different field but thats why Im interested in BA and MINS While these concentrations may not aide in finding a finance related jobcareer it would make me feel confident knowing I have the skills if I ever wanted to change paths and they just seem fun I also posted this on my colleges reddit forum but have not got any responses yet so I figured this would be the next best place Thanks",2,6,2024-12-10 17:00:15,analytics,32,2087

So I work in SaaS looking at enterprise customer tickets and analysing the relevant data etc Weve had a past migration of systems in 2022 and a lot of my initial work under a different manager as an intern was stitching together the data to keep a continuity so we have several years of historical data for analysis and forecasting Now obviously internal processes change over time so So in my current managers eyes this historical data is not important for new data visualisations and projects as it doesnt represent the current situation While this is true I dont believe we should be casting aside data just because it doesnt fit a certain narrative

1h6wpfj,Should I ask for a title change,"About a month ago I started a job at my colleges Career Design Center as a Career Peer Im a sophomore studying Data Analytics with a minor in Computer Science and I was told my role would involve a little bit of data work relevant to my major but would mostly consist of administrative tasks like answering phone calls reviewing resumes and setting up appointments

However after my training period my responsibilities turned out to be mostly datafocused Heres what Ive been doing

		Collecting and cleaning data to optimize our social media content types and post timing
		Analyzing data on previous career fairs including trends in attendance by major which companies are hiring specific majors both for jobs and internships and associated salary data
		Using this analysis to suggest which companies should return which new companies we should contact and how to address underrepresented majors at our fairs

Basically Ive been using Meta Business Suite to create excel files or cleaning existing excel files from career fairs to then import them into an SQL server analyze the data and create Tableau reports to share insights with my supervisors I definitely am not an expert at any of this and am only using what Ive learned the past couple years in school I could definitely be doing things more efficiently but Im just working with the knowledge I have for the time being If I wouldve known I had these responsibilities when applying for the job I dont think I wouldve qualified haha 

Either way given these responsibilities I think that my current title Career Peer doesnt reflect what Im actually doing I want to ensure this experience stands out on my resume especially as I apply for summer internships in datarelated fields

Do you have suggestions for more accurate job titles I could propose or use on my resume Im not entirely sure what the best and most accurate data related title I could use Should I even change my job title Im not doing it for a pay bump even though Im paid minimum wage I just want to make sure my work is reflected properly Thoughts",2,3,2024-12-05 01:03:56,analytics,31,2073

I have a problem that is close to survival analysis but not quite

The analog to my actual problem is this  
lets say I have an ad campaign through FB IG and Tk  specifically targeting 1000 known user in my members list If one buys the product the campaign in the other platforms automatically closes for that user

I can use survival analysis to see which campaign is faster and more effective by testing time to buy
But its not classic The three campaign eat the same population Lets say instegram get 10 buys on the first day These users can only be counted as censored for the other platforms
But it feels too simplistic and makes it seem like the losing campaign succeeded
I read about competing events but it doesnt sound right eather as one event doesnt logically block the others like death event and intubation event they can randomly block each other


So to summarize  
Is there a version of survival analysis where multiple risk factor with different halflives and different plateaus pray on the same population And can the parameters be estimated in the live observation with all risks running without conducting a different test for each",5,5,2024-12-04 16:30:02,analytics,30,1158

 If the minimum sample size has not yet been collected it shows how many more days are needed to collect it to avoid stopping the test too soon

 If the minimum sample size has already been collected it shows whether the result is statistically significant

This approach can sometimes be problematic lets say my data is

baseline conversion 105

assumed MDE  5 relative

minimum sample size on this basis 596 k sessions per variant

So after 2 weeks of the test I still get information in the dashboard that I need data for several hundred more days Now 2 examples of the results on the dashboard

a ver A 105 ver B 124 18 diff  difference not statistically significant

b ver A 105 ver B 141 34 diff  difference statistically significant

So Im aware that I havent collected enough traffic based on my assumptions but I see differences much higher than the assumed MDE even significant for b My questions are

How should i approach this Should i adjust my initial assumptions

 Can i trust the result b if it shows significance without collecting enough traffic What if these results are observed after 2 days should i still trust them or can assume its due to random noise Where is the line

I have read the What if the Observed Effect is Smaller Than the MDE  AnalyticsToolkitcom article I remember coclusions that MDE and observed effect shouldnt be compared but with such big differences it doesnt seem to be intuitive

Both are trying to follow a Data Mesh Architecture  
Both dont have a strict DG framework implemented  Ill have contributions to it but will not implement it directly  
Dont know exactly which tools Ill work with  
Both dont work in agile methodology since Ill work alone defining something and not necessarily build projects  
Concerns tasks are not directly related with DG tasks   
Pros Strategic position Possibility to work with DG Working on a Data Mesh centric idea possibly designing data products oh sh developing data products without a DG framework already implemented

Would I benefit from a bootcamp program There is one offered at a local college but I think its like 10k Or do I need to go to grad school in data analytics Or is this something that can be selftaught Any helpadvice would be appreciated",3,8,2024-11-26 14:19:16,analytics,25,711

Anyway I wanted a good job to fill in for slow months in the business I decided on data analytics because it was interesting to me and it seemed like there was a lot of room for growthlearning So I did the data analyst career track on Datacamp and really enjoyed it and want to continue my learning

Im just trying to figure out if this is possible and if so what my next step should be I would prefer not to go back to a university but I do like structured learning So I have been considering potentially doing a BootCamp I know that it will be harder for me since Ill probably get filtered out for not having a degree a lot of the time I was thinking it might be better to try to get an internship before a job Thanks for reading all of this and hopefully some of you can give me some guidance on this",9,35,2024-11-26 05:43:35,analytics,84,1339

So Ive been starting to go through some decent tutorials Ive found online to refamiliarize myself with the processes I learned in classmainly Python and Jupyter Notebooks since thats what school used I plan to learn about using other tools as well such as Tableau and I have a personal project Im planning as well Tbh Ive had way more fun doing this compared to even just thinking of writing code for things like apps and websites 

Thats gotten me thinking about doing a Masters via something like WGU or Georgia Techs online program since I can afford themI have money saved up But I also dont want to make a decision to drop that much cash lightly so I wanted to ask here How worth it would it be to get a Masters and should I just focus on finding freecheap courses online to take and doing personal projects instead

1gykfd8,How should I go about  making things more efficient,"Some context

I interned at this organisation for a year and now that I am expected to graduate I have been contracted by the organisation to help out with making the data analysis and validation process efficient and as automated as it can be The oganisation uses Microsoft 365 license and hence has all the access to the Power apps Unfortunately the team is too busy with their portfolio it is not a data team to really find the time for improving efficiency

The expectation is that I will be able to help them out make things more automated and use my data analytics skills to provide them with monthly insights It is a government organisation and hence will not allow the usage of PythonR as they deem it to be unnecessary and potentially dangerous I do not mind that as I have had good experience with working on PowerBI and Excel The issue however is that the data is not on a SQL server or a datalake which will allow PowerBI to perform the required ETL and allow me to analyse 

What is the problem statement 

The data comes in as a standalone Excel submission from the service providers These files are then individually validated analysed and insights gathered This can get really inefficient and overwhelming very quick as the project keeps moving forward The Excel file has data that would literally be nightmare for PowerBI to work on It is not in a Tidy format 

What I intend to do 

I have this idea in my head where I could potentially automate the data cleaning process using Power Query Our service providers submit the data in the exact same format each month So using Power Query would allow me to convert the data into a tidy format allowing me to feed it into PowerBI and analysecreate dashboards As the Excel template does not change a simple refresh should update the data each month The Microsoft 365 license means that we also have Sharepoint access I also intend to make good use of this so that everything is now centralized easily accessible and updated on the go I also hear a lot about the automation benefits of Power Automate but have never usedexperienced it I am more than willing to learn this and implement

Your inputs in this which would help a lot

Firstly how I could use Power Automate as a resource to help streamline the process  Do you think I have the right approach to the problem What are some of the pitfalls I could fall into considering I will be the only data person in the team and will need to contact the business intelligence team of the organisation for any specific help my manager is willing to support me and get help from other departments but this is usually easier said than done",6,3,2024-11-24 06:14:52,analytics,51,2645

Enterprise Data Management Explores how the data warehouse provides the foundation for analytics within the enterprise Topics include dimensional models design and creation of data warehouses and data marts ETL process and the extension of the data warehouse concept to big data

Machine Learning  AI Applications with Python Machine learning is pervasive with highstakes applications spanning all business sectors including fraud detection highfrequency trading and highly personalized and relevant marketing campaigns Machine learning requires interdisciplinary techniques to create algorithms that sift through large volumes of data to support business decisionmaking This class will equip students with the analytical techniques and skills to build and evaluate machine learning models using Python In addition students will use Python for a handson exploration of a broad crosssection of algorithms for machine learning including linear models and dimensionality reduction Students will gain additional familiarity with deep learning models such as artificial recurrent and long shortterm memory neural networks Cloudbased resources and the opensource frameworks TensorFlow and Keras will be leveraged At the end of the course students will be prepared for accurate effective and ethical research or industry application of machine learning techniques

Feel free to critique my methods recent grad but what I did was take this distribution heavily right skewed find the mean and SD and use those values to solve for the rate and shape parameters of a Gamma distribution I felt it was most appropriate Once I had this approximate distribution I did a loop of taking random samples for n1 to 300 many times to get a distribution of sample means

Now that I have my different distributions of means when you plot them you see most are approximately normal CLT but what I was interested in was how the tails would become shorter as n gets larger a customer having more tickets so now what we did was compare that to our observations and see which customers have a TTR that fall outside of our 95 range of means for the given n hence better highlighting the customers that received an especially bad service

While I believe the applicable business value of this is quite minimal a customer doesnt care about probability distributions just their own individual service and just looking at the data before this experiment would tell you who has been receiving a poor quality service I did find this to be quite fun especially for a work environment So maybe this could serve as a message to those that dont enjoy their job enough that maybe we can create our own opportunities to do fun experiments

1gubrrn,How Important is Linear Alegebra etc Truly in Data Analytics,"Pretty much the title Im someone who came from a business background financeaccounting and have a good amount of experience transforminganalyzing data from largedisparate sources and presenting key findings to executives across a range of business problems While Im certainly not THE most technical or quantitative person on an analytics team I do have a relatively strong albeit limited background in certain data skills such as Pythonstatistics such that I was able to solve problems or do some of the work myself when more technical folks were busy or otherwise unable to help

I want to keep building on my data skills because I frankly enjoy analyzing and explaining datagenerating insights moreso than I do the regular cadence of reporting that I am forced to do in financeaccounting roles I also want to analyze and solve problems beyond just profitloss metrics 

When I look online I keep seeing that fairly advanced math ie Linear Algebra is often seen as foundational knowledge for data scienceanalytics My question is how correct is this outside of the highest levels of data science ie FAANG or other very datacentric organizations To be blunt Ive found the following to be most useful in my career so far

1 Being able to transform or build data models that aggregategenerate reports that a business partnerstakeholder can understand quickly and without error To me SQLPython are generally good enough to solve this as you can use these tools to ETL the data and then Excel to put it into a spreadsheet for folks to see trends or create their own adhoc analyses

2 Once step 1 is done simple definition of KPIs that are meaningful being able to track them as well as some visuals dashboards etc to slice and dice data To be honest I can solve for this via PowerBI maybe even Excel using pivot tables The first part of defining business requirements etc mostly comes from having good business sense or domain knowledge Dont really see a use case for linear algebra etc type of math here either

3 Strong communication skills and being able to present the sowhat in plain english Again Id almost argue that using really complex algorithms or advanced math will confuse the average business user Candidly Ive never found much use for executives to present anything beyond some regressions which I dont believe requires a ton of advanced math correct me if Im wrong here 

So can someone help me understand where the major use cases for really advanced algosmath come up within the data world I feel like theres something Im missing so would really appreciate some insight Further if anyone has good resources that explain practical use cases of linear algebra etc when coding thatd be great I find trying to pick up linear algebra by studying the theory hasnt been helpful and Id love to understand more practical examples of how I can apply it while furthering my education

1gueinu,Currently in cloud administration debating switching to data analytics or marketing,"Im a cloud admin thinking of switching careers to data analytics or marketing The interviews in tech seems really intense even after working in tech for a few years as a system or cloud admin The interviews feel like tests where they want you to memorize multiple applications processes and steps The hiring for the last year has been ruthless too and Ive had less responses from jobs even though I have more experience 

I thought of data analytics first because it relies less on programming like powershell javascript or cisco commands It also is more interesting analyzing charts Im interested in investing so observing patterns and seeing how changes can improve company earnings interests me because you actually see a result from your work I feel the charts are less abstract than random powershell scripts that you would use as a cloud admin 

Idk if itd be possible for me to switch to data analytics I dont have a tech degree I do have 4 cloud certs and CompTIA Ive been in a few tech jobs over the last 4 years Would I need an MBA or to go back for another bachelors

My last option is marketing Because I like the analytical nature similar to data analytics The different advertising creative ideas interest me as well I also like that its not as technical However Im an introvert so idk if it would require a lot of direct facing customer work Ive heard some say the pay isnt great and its like a sales job is this true

In 2020 with global lockdowns and the explosive growth of TikTok the number and significance of content creators skyrocketed TikTok in particular was initially dismissed by many brands as a passing trend for teenagers yet its now a dominant platform in online engagement  


 TikTok Demographics April 2024

 Men 1824 189
 Women 2534 146
 Men 2534 193
 Women 3544 69

 A FourHour Audit with a Jewelry Store

Yesterday we spent four hours auditing a jewelry store that launched in 2018 This store had effectively used influencers and content creators to drive sales until mid2023

Our audit focused on data from 2022 onwards Together with the owner we analyzed current sales numbers and past marketing activities to understand the impact of various strategies



 Snapshot of Online Performance and Advertising Costs

 Until Summer 2023 The store maintained a network of relevant influencers and content creators who consistently converted traffic into sales
 Since Mid2023 The store reduced its partnerships retaining only a few key creators from earlier years Since then performance has gradually declined



 Performance Highlights from the Audit

2023 Summary

 Sessions GA4 data 541203
 Contacts in Database 13935
 Orders 6538
 Average Order Value 24858 RON
 Revenue 1625216 RON
 Unconverted Contacts 7397
 Potential Losses 183874626 RON due to weak communication with existing customers

2024 YeartoDate through Nov 13

 Sessions GA4 data 323374
 Contacts in Database 20023
 Orders 4491
 Average Order Value 25879 RON
 Revenue 116222589 RON
 Unconverted Contacts 15532
 Potential Losses 401952628 RON from poor engagement with the existing audience



 Key Insights and Takeaways

1 Organic Reach Builds LongTerm Value Organic engagement is crucial for building a durable profitable brand Brands that establish a strong online presence through organic channels stand the test of time
2 Content Creators Are Essential Content creators dont just put your products in front of an audience they lend credibility Their influence builds trust and can make a significant difference in purchase decisions
3 A WellDefined Strategy Drives Success Brand strength isnt just about ad spend but also about market relevance Consistency visibility and perception are powerful elements in brand growth
4 Customer Neglect Can Be Costly Neglecting your audience especially those whove already shown interest by engaging with your promotions can cost you Failure to nurture these relationships can lead to substantial revenue losses
5 Understanding the Digital Landscape is Key The internet works through specific mechanisms particularly those focused on capturing attention Understanding these can unlock new opportunities increase sales and open doors for growth



 Platform Performance Analysis 2022

From the analysis conducted on Meta Google TikTok and Email Marketingplatforms the store has utilized since 2022

 Out of 6872 total orders on the site in 2022
    Meta generated 3466 orders
    Google TikTok and Email Marketing combined 20 orders
    Organic InfluencerDriven 3406 orders

Key Insight Nearly 50 of total sales came organically largely driven by influencer collaborations established years prior to 2022 When the store reduced these partnerships performance began to gradually decline



 Conclusion and Next Steps for 2025

This audit revealed core issues facing the store During the four hours of analysis we focused on hard data and critical metrics that used to be strengths but are now missing We didnt even look at creative elements like ad copy or target audiences

Thanks to the store owner for dedicating time to this audit Were excited to start working together and unlock the stores full potential in the upcoming year

Currently the company offers a natural gas appliance protection plan with a monthly fee and maintenance services are provided by a thirdparty contractor Recently this contractor raised their prices which has reduced the current margin to nearly zero Ive been assigned the task of reviewing the pricing but I have no prior experience in service pricing and dont know where to start also this position was created and there is no significant work done before

Logically I believe I should list all the costs related to the service calculate a cost price set a margin considering the competition and then decide on the new price However how is this practically done Do we project costs and revenues over a certain horizon If so how do we determine that horizon How do we calculate the overhead allocation ratio for this service How do we assess profitability Where exactly do we apply the desired margin Should we stop at EBITDA or continue to net profit

Im looking for someone or a few people to collaborate with on building this data bank 



Heres the plan and structure Ive developed so far

 Data Collection

 Methods Well gather data using surveys forms and other efficient tools minimizing the need for manual input
 Tagging System Each entry will have tags for easy labeling and filtering This will help us identify and handle incomplete or unverified data more effectively

 Database Layout

 Separate Tables Different types of data will be organized in separate tables such as Basic Info Psychological Data and Survey Responses
 Linking Data Unique IDs eg userid will link data across tables allowing smooth and effective crosscategory analysis
 Version Tracking A version field will store previous data versions helping us track changes over time

 Data Analysis

 Manual Analysis Initially well analyze data manually but set up prebuilt queries to simplify pattern identification and insight discovery
 PreBuilt Queries Custom views will display demographic averages opinion trends and behavioral patterns offering us quick insights

 Permissions and User Tracking

 Roles Well establish three roles
    Admins  full access
    SemiAdmins  require Admin approval for changes
    Viewers  viewonly access
 Audit Log An audit log will track actions in the database helping us monitor who made each change and when

 Backups Security and Exporting

 Backups Regular backups will be scheduled to prevent data loss
 Security Security will be minimal for now as we dont expect to handle highly sensitive data
 Exporting and Flexibility Well make data exportable in CSV and JSON formats and add a tagging system to keep the setup flexible for future expansion",1,1,2024-11-07 18:51:10,analytics,41,2143

1gk4e5a,CS to DA career path switch where to begin,"Hi Im a CS graduate more specifically cyber security but ive had little to no luck in landing any jobs in my field Ive been applying relentlessly for exactly a year now not even internships where I live

Market is super saturated for anything remotely related to tech even for DA however I find it still has good opportunities where I can land at least an entry level position

I do have some background on analytics Ive done some research on SAS completed the Microsoft Power BI course for data analysis and I also have basic knowledge of SQL but I still dont feel as though Im ready I dont have any work experience in DA I see many posts about how courses are not enough until you apply DA on real work and how recruiters wont take your certificationscourses into consideration and really will only look at past experience in Data Analysis so how am I supposed to start

I currently have a job in sales its all over the place as I do supply chain and some sales reporting here and there and Ive tried to incorporate my own version of analytics into my reporting but I do not see excel reporting as enough and for the life of me I wouldnt have a clue on how more to incorporate DA into my worklife

So dumb it down for me tell me where to start what to focus on what certifications I should do what has helped you what tools you find best personally what suggestions and example sets should I try to work on at my own pace all of it

My issue is I need to follow a set of rules but I cant even begin to make myself a schedule to follow with the end goal being a DA job because I truly have no clue where to begin

Sorry to sound like a child but its really one of those moments where my brain is insisting I get into it but is not leading me towards any clues or starting points

EDIT I forgot to mention Im open to learning more about any other analyticsrelated field as long as I feel like I am a good fit to understand it and I can follow through but I dont think Im knowledgeable enough on other analytics fields to make that decision but I would like to give myself enough credit to note that if I really put my mind to something Im more than likely to excel by all means so feel free to suggest anything for me Thanks a lot",10,12,2024-11-05 11:18:59,analytics,42,2230
